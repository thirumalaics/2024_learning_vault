- what is Runner?
	- class defined under google.adk.runners
	- engine that brings agents to life
	- acts as a bridge between our application code(which initiates the interaction) and the agent
- what are the core responsibilities of the runner?
	- session management
		- create, update and retrieve sessions
		- save, update and retrieve state
		- load conversation history
	- Agent invocation
		- identify correct root agents to invoke or resume
		- can be called with run_async or run_live
	- context creation
		- it constructs context object
		- provides agent with necessary info(session, service, user input, run configuration)
