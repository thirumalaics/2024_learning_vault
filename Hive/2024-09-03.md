## Internal vs External table
- for internal table, if the data is in hive warehouse directory or hdfs, hive does not allow access from other applications directly to the file
- hadoop UI: `localhost:50075`
	- one use is to navigate the file system
- after creating an external table, this guy loaded the data into table using the same:
	- `load data local inpath '/home/jivesh/files/table1 into table tabel12'`
		- by running the above command, the file table1 is copied into the hdfs hive warehouse's table location
	- in external table as well, we can give a location but if not given, the folder for the table will be created under the /user/hive/warehouse
		- there was not default folder for the default database
		- he said hive is not responsible for the data files but HDFS is
		- access to the files of an external table are restricted by HDFS security

## Insert Statement
- by default column names are not printed in hive cli, we have to configure:
	- set hive.cli.print.header = true;
- while inserting, if we try to insert a string col to int col, the int col will be filled with null
- `create table tab (col1 int, col2 string, col3 string) stored as textfile;`
	- this table is created as a target table for the insert, here do not give details like field and line delimiter etc..
	- because here we are not loading data from a file, here we are loading data from a hive table which is already structured
- `insert into table tab select col1, col2, col3 from employees`
	- mismatching data type insert is filled with null
	- into means append by default
- `insert overwrite table tab select col1, col2, col3 from employees`
## Multi insert statement
- from one source table, insert data into multiple tables
- `from empl insert into table developer_tab select col1,col2, col3 where col3 = 'dev' insert into table manager_tab select col1, col2, col3 where col3 = 'M';`
## Alter table
- adding new columns, changing names or data types of the columns, and renaming the table
- `DESC tab;` : to describe the table
- `alter table tab add columns (col4 string, col5 int);`
	- these newly added columns will be filled with nulls as long as we do not link this table to a file with 5 columns
- add column after a specific column
	- `alter table tab change col1 col1 int after col3;`
	- repositions the old column col1 after column 3
	- the first col1 denotes the old name
		- here new name and old name are both same
	- the data did not change position
	- confusing
- changing column name
	- `alter table tab change column col2 new_col2 string;`
- renaming table 
	- `alter table tab rename to tab1;`
- removing columns
	- `alter table tab1 replace columns (id int, name string);`
	- this only retains the first two columns and renames the columns to id and string
- table can be created with table properties
	- `create table test1 (col1 int, col2 string) stored as textfile tblproperties('skip.header.line.count' = '3')`
	- table property, atleast the following one can be added after creating a table
	- `alter table tab1 set tblproperties('auto.purge' = 'true');`
	- `alter table tab1 set fileformat avro;`
- `desc formatted tab1;`
	- all md associated with the table are listed

## Sorting in Hive
- order by, sort by distribute by, cluster by
- order by guarantees full sorting of our data
	- for this it needs to be passed through a single reducer
	- `SELECT col2 from table3 order by col2`
	- limitations of order by clause:
		- in strict mode, order by clause must be followed by limit clause
		- limit clause is mandatory because we are passing the data to one reducer
		- single reducer might take long time to finish
		- `select col2 from table5 order by col2 limit 4;
- sort by 
	- also does sorting
	- sort by will do sorting within a reducer not among all the reducer
		- the result did not look fully sorted
		- it looked like partition by followed by sort by
	- does not guarantee full sorting
	- `select col2 from table5 sort by col2;`
