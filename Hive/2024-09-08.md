## Join 3 tables in hive
- if all three tables are joined using the same key columns, one map-reduce job is triggered
- if the join key columns are different then more than one mr job is triggered

## Memory management & Optimization of joins
- by default last table in a query is streamed and rest are buffered in memory
- in the following cases
	- if all three tables are joined using the same key columns, one map-reduce job is triggered
		- first two tables in the query are buffered in memory
		- the last table in join is streamed
	- if the join key columns are different then more than one mr job is triggered
		- first join: left table buffered, right table streamed
		- second join: first join result buffered, right table streamed
- so it goes like the biggest table should remain on the right hand side(bigger than the buffer mem)
	- by doin this we avoid the risk of potential OOM
- in cases where we cannot position the big table on the right most side of the table, we can explicitly provide a hint to hive to stream the table rather than having it buffered
	- `SELECT /*+ STREAMTABLE (emp_tab) */ col1, col2 etc..`

## Map joins
- when one of tables involved in the join is small enough to be held in one mapper mem itself, then there is no need for a reducer step
	- the join can be performed in mapper side itself
- we can tell hive to perform map join in two ways
	- hint in the query
		- `select /*+ MAPJOIN(emp_tab) */ * FRom empt_tab join dept_tab on emp_tab.x = dept_tab.y`
	- place the responsibility on to hive to decide whether to perform map joins
		- set some properties
		- `set hive.auto.convert.join=true`
		- `set hive.mapjoin.smalltable.filesize=25000000`
			- 25MB default
			- any table with size less than equal to this size is considered for map-side join
			- this table will be cached in mapper's mem
- limitations: 
	- full outer joins not possible
		- no error is thrown even when we hint a map side join
		- the join happens normally with a reducer
- bucketed map joins
	- in here, respective buckets of tables are sent to respective mappers to perform map side join
		- does this mean, one mapper per bucket
	- some properties need to be set in order to allow this join
	- `set hive.input.format=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.BucketizedHiveInputFormat;`
	- `set hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin=true;`
	- `set hive.auto.convert.sortmerge.join=true`
	- `set hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin.sortedmerge=true`
		- there is something called as sort merge bucket map join
	- bucket joins condition #doubt 
		- both tables involved in the join must have same number of buckets and they must be joined based on the bucketing column
		- there is a contradicting statement in [here](https://www.clairvoyant.ai/blog/bucket-map-join-in-hive)
			- one table should have buckets in multiples of the number of buckets in another table
				- ex: one side 3 buckets, other side 3 or 6 or 9
			- if this condition is satisfied, then the joining operation of the tables can be performed at the mapper side only


## Views
- views do not contain any data of its own
- all type of dml operations can be performed on views
- can be created by selecting any number of rows or columns of its base tables
- once created, the schema of view is frozen and is independent of changes made to base table schema
- to change view schema, we have to use alter view command
	- changing the view schema does not change table schema
- views are read only
	- any drop or write queries on view will not affect our base table
- dropping the base table invalidates the view and makes hive throw errors on the queries
- `CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS emp_view1 as SELECT * FROM emp_tbl;`
- `alter view emp_view1 as select col1 from emp_tab;`
- `alter view emp_view1 rename to emp_view2;`
- `drop view emp_view2;`
- show tables command displays views and tables
- adv of views
	- views can be used to hide underlying table columns from some users
	- views protect our base table from being accidentally dropped or altered
	- views can help turning the lengthy and complicated query into a one-liner
## Indexing
- an index acts as reference to records
- used to speed up searching the data
- will search for only portion of data and not whole dataset
- partition done at hdfs, indexing done at table level
- since hive works with large datasets, indexing is beneficial
- `create index i1 on table table9(col3) as 'COMPACT' with deferred rebuild;`
- two types of indexes can be created on a table in hive
	- compact and bitmap
	- main difference is storing of mapped values of rows in diff blocks
	- compact indexing stores the pair of indexed column value and it's block id
	- bm indexing stores the combination of indexed col value and list of rows as a bitmap
