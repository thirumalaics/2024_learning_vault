- limitation of bucketing
	- does not makes sure if the data is properly loaded in the table
	- we have to handle this data loading to buckets by ourselves

## Table-sampling
- sample of data from a table
- limit tries to take data from one partition and one bucket
- table sampling collects data from multiple partitions/buckets
	- data returned is distributed, since it will not be from the same bucket or partition
- `select deptno, empname, sal, location from dept_buck tablesample (bucket 1 out of 2 on location);`
	- the table queried has 4 buckets
	- the table sample command given divides the 4 buckets into groups of two buckets each and selecting first bucket of every group
- table sampling can be done on non-bucketed column as well
	- in that case the entire table is scanned
- sampling can also be done based on other parameters: % or number of rows
	- `select * from dept_buck tablesample (2 percent);`
		- 2% is a lower limit and treated as at least
	- `select * from dept_buck tablesample (1M);`
		- if the table content is smaller than the given size, the entire table is read
	- `select * from dept_buck tablesample(20 rows);`
		- the 20 rows are selected from each input split

## No drop, offline command
- no drop
	- this clause prevents our table/ partition from being accidentally dropped
- `ALTER TABLE dept_buck enable no_drop;`
	- after this clause is added, any attempt to drop the table is faced with an error
	- to disable:
		- `alter table emp_tab disable no_drop;`
- `alter table part_dept partition (deptname = "HR") enable no_drop;`
	- to disable:
		- `alter table part_dept partition (deptname = 'HR') disable no_drop;`
- offline
	- clause that prevents the table from being queried
	- `alter table table_name enable offline;`
		- querying this table after  this clause gives us an error
	- `alter table table_name disable offline;`
	- `alter table part_table partition (deptname = 'Accounts') enable offline;`
	- `alter table part_table partition (deptname = 'Accounts') disable offline;`
- hive only equi inner joins
	- when he ran left outer join with > operator also hive did not allow
