- RC and ORC are two diff file formats
- each file format has it's own table properties
- `create table table5 (col1 string, col2 int) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n' stored as orc tblproperties("orc.compress"="zlib");`
	- other available compression codecs: BZIP2, GZIP, Snappy
- other properties include:
	- `orc.compress.size = "value"`
		- determines number of bytes in each compression chunk
	- `orc.strip.size = "value"`
		- determines number of bytes in each stripe
	- `orc.row.index.stride = "value"`
		- number of rows bw index entries and it must be greater than 1000
	- `orc.create.index = "true or false"`
	- `orc.bloom.filter.columns`
		- comma separated list of column names for which bloom filter should be created
	- `orc.bloom.filter.fpp`
		- probability for the bloom filter
- `show tblproperties table4;`

## Hive configurations
- these can be set in hive level or hadoop level
- these properties can be set in hive.xml or .HiveRC file also
- session level configs can be set as well
- `set dfs.block.size;`
	- this command displays the value in effect
