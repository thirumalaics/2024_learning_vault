- 3 words to describe big data : volume, velocity and variety
- the big word does not just describe the volume but also the scope
- but data has been varying in other dimensions such as: 
	- veracity, variability, volatility, visualization and value
- volume
	- amount of generated within seconds
- velocity
	- speed at which the data is generated, stored, analyzed and moved around
- variety
	- refers to different data formats
	- structured, semi structured, un structured
	- structured - data stored as fixed fields within a record
	- one of the major challenges is dealing with varieties of data formats
		- by dealing, I mean analyzing and storing
- veracity
	- quality of data, such as trustworthiness, biases, noise and abnormality
	- we have to make sure data is correct and the processes to do that is very important
- variability
	- changing of data
	- same data could have different meanings in different contexts
- volatility
	- how long the data is valid and stored
- visualization
	- way of making data well understood
- value
	- refers to knowledge gained from data analysis on big data

## The relation and NoSQL dbs versus Hadoop
- when dealing with big amount of data, hadoop is the best choice
	- linear scalable, fast, and stable to deal with the big volume of data
- when we deal with a small amount of data, a rdb is always the best choice
	- since it is fast and agile to deal with a small or moderate amount of data
- nosql dbs are said to offer characteristics and balance from both rdb and hadoop  
	- in terms of good performance and various data format support for moderate to large amounts of data
