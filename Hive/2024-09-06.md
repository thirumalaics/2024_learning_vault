## Partitioning and Bucketing
- static partitioning
	- `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS part_dept (deptno int, empname string, sal int) partitioned by (deptname string) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n' stored as textfile;`
	- note that the partition column is not part of the schema
		- he mentions that this is only for static partition
	- `insert into table part_dept partition(deptname = 'HR') select col1, col3, col4 from dept where col2 = 'HR';`
		- while defining deptname = 'HR', we can give any name we like
		- it is not necessary to match the value of partition column for which the files will be present in the directory
		- even the following insert works fine:
		- `insert into table part_dept partition(deptname ='XYZ') SELECT col1, col3, col4 from dept where col2= 'HR'`
		- hive does not cross check the values of col2 and deptname
	- we can also load static partitions using load command, in that case data should be segregated priorly on partition column
		- if there are files already separated by the column value we want, each file can be loaded into it's partition by a separate load command
		- `load data local inpath '/home/jivesh/act' into table part_dept partition (deptname = 'XZ');`
- dynamic partition
	- hive creates partitions based on partition column value
	- by default disabled
	- `set hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;`
	- `set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict`
		- by default the mode is strict
		- in strict mode, we have at least define one static partition along with other dynamic partitions in case if we are performing partitions on multiple column
		- `paritioned by (deptname, sal)`
		- this config needs to be changed to enable all partition to be determined dynamically, [source](https://aaneja.wordpress.com/2020/09/15/strict-mode-vs-non-strict-mode-in-hive-or-static-partition-vs-dynamic-partition-in-hive/)
	- table creation is similar to static partitioning
	- `Create table if not exists part_dept1 (deptno int, empname string, sal int) partitioned by (deptname string) row format deleted fields terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n' stored as textfile;` 
	- the partition column is not part of the schema in here as well
	- `insert into table part_dept1 partition (deptname) select col1,col3,col4, col2 from dept;`
	- the column in the query which will be used for partitioning must appear as the last column in the query
	- obviously the folders created under the table folder contain the values as in the data:
		- deptname=Accounts
- use static partitioning when we know the values in the data
	- opposite for dynamic partitioning
	- dynamic is obviously slower because hive has to do the heavy lifting

## Alter partitioned table and MSCK Repair command
- `show partitions part_dept1;`
	- command to show the partitions that exists within the table
- `alter table part_dept1 drop partition (deptname = 'HR');`
	- when we drop a partition both data and md are dropped for a manage table 
	- where as for a external table, only the partition md is removed from hive which makes it unqueryable
- `alter table part_dept1 add partition (deptname = 'Dev');`
	- manually adding partition to a dynamically partitioned table is possible
	- obviously the data will not magically appear now
	- use insert or load to manually load command
	- `load data local inpath '/home/sadaspda/dsa' into table part_dept1 partition (deptname='Dev');`
- adding a partition folder in the table's path in hdfs does not make hive consider this folder as a partition
	- hive does not have the md of the directory that was added in hdfs
	- to add md, there are two ways
		- first is to add the partition manually
			- `alter table part_dept1 add partition (deptname = 'Finance');`
			- running the above command makes hive realize the new partition
		- msck repair command
			- `msck repair table part_dept1;`

## Bucketing
- data organization technique
- all rows with same key column values will go into the same bucket
- bucketing can be done without partition but the performance improvements are enhanced if done with partitioning
	- bucketing results a set of files
	- hashing algo determines which record goes into which file
- by default bucketing is not enabled, we have to enable it by:
	- `set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;`
- `create table if not exists dept_buck (deptno int, empname string, sal int, location string) partitioned by (deptname string) clustered by (location) into 4 buckets row format delimited fields terminated by ',' lines delimited by '\n' stored as textfile;`
- `insert into table dept_buck partition (deptname) select col1, col3, col4, col5, col2 from dept_with_loc;`
	- the number of reduce tasks will be equal to the number of buckets we have provided in the DDL
- bucketing can sometimes be more efficient when used alone
	- when the column has many unique values, partitioning can damage performance
	- use bucketing instead
- bucketed map joins are the fastest joins
	- performing join based on the bucket columns on both sides is faster
		- condition: both joining tables should be bucketed on the same column as of joining column and both tables should have equal number of buckets
- limitations of bucketing
