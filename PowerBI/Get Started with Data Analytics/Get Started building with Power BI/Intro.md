## Building blocks of PBI
- semantic models 
	- consists of all connected data, transformations, relationships and calculations
	- to create a semantic model
		- connect to data, transform data and create relationships and calculations
- visualizations
	- visualizations are created in a report
	- report can have pages
	- each page has it's own canvas where visualizations can be added
	- we can drag and drop data fields onto the canvas and pbi will choose a visual for our data field
		- we can change bw visuals
## Dashboard
- can be created after we have published a report
- dashboard consists of a single page made up of tiles
- add tiles to a dashboard by pinning a visual in a report to the dashboard
- tiles are not interactive like visuals, so when a user interacts with the tile, they go to the underlying report for more information
- dashboards are a good way to provide high-level information to consumers
