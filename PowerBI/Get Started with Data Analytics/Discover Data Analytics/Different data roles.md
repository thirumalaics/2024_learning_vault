## Tasks of a data analyst
- prepare
	- one of two most common tasks
	- avoiding deficient or incorrect data is the goal
	- data prep: process of profiling, cleaning and transforming our data to get it ready to model and visualize
		- what is given in the microsoft documentation looks more like a de's task
		- ensuring integrity, correcting wrong or inaccurate data, identifying missing data, converting data from one structure to another, converting types or even making the data more readable
	- data prep also involves understanding how we are going to get and connect to the data and the performance implications of the decisions
	- privacy and security assurances are also important
- model
	- data modeling: process of determining how tables are related to each other
		- not only above but also defining how data is structured, stored
	- data model has direct impact on the performance of our report and overall data analysis
- visualize
- analyze
	- understanding and interpreting the information that is displayed on the report
- manage
	- overseeing sharing and distribution of items while ensuring their security
