- typical solutions to commonly recurring problems in object oriented sw design
	- pre-made blue print
		- we can see what the result and it's feature will look like but the exact order of implementation is left to us
	- they are not literally code snippets
	- gives concept to solve the problem
	- patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in sw design

- not the same as algorithms
	- algo is clear step by step
	- whereas design pattern is a high level description of a solution
	- the code for the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different

## What does the pattern consist of?
- intent: briefly explains the problem that the pattern solves and solution itself
- motivation: further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible
- structure: of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related
- code example

## Classification of patterns
- DP differ by their - but these are not classification properties used in this site
	- complexity
	- level of detail
	- scale of applicability to the entire system being designed
- most basic and low-level patterns are often called ***idioms***
	- usually apply to a single programming language
- the most universal and high level patterns are ***architectural patterns***
	- not language bound
	- can be used to design the architecture of an entire application

- all patterns can categorized based on their intent or purpose
	- creational patterns: provide object creation mech that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code
		- they aim to solve the problem of creating objects in a way that is more suitable to the situation, rather than directly instantiating objects with constructors
	- structural patterns: explains how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient
	- behavioral patterns: takes care of effective communication and assignment of responsibilities bw objects
