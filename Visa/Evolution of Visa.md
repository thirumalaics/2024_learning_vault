## four party model
- heart of the payments ecosystem
- four key players provide the foundation that enables all of us to transact
- Issuer, Acquirer, Merchant, Card holder
- issuer: card issuer
	- issuer makes the potential card holder go through card issuance process
		- can be credit or debit
	 - application evaluation happens
	 - application decision
	 - sets and collects card fees/interest rates
	 - provides customer service
	 - responsible for the credit risk of txns
		 - the issuer will have to absorb txns, which the user declares is wrong or not made by him/her,as a loss 
			 - this is called write-off
	 - custodian of the cardholder information
- cardholder
	- we use the card for payments
	- responsible for paying the issuer
	- can be a consumer, commercial, small business
- merchant
	- based solely on the belief that the card payments get them the money owed by the cardholder, they give out goods and services
	- there is a process to get the cash represented by the card payment
		- this takes place bw acquirer and merchant
	- has contractual relationship with the acquirer that enables them to accept cards for payments
	- does not have direct relationship with card nws like visa but they have to follow rules when accepting cards
		- it is the acquirer's role to ensure that the merchant knows those rules and processes each and every sale properly
- acquirer: 
	- a financial institution
	- signs up merchants to accept cards for payments
	- review business model of the merchant
	- provide the terminal to accept card payments
	- provide training to the merchant as well as customer services
	- pay the merchant for the purchases made
	- manages any issues that may be brought up by the issuer in the dispute process
		- dispute process is managed by visa and allows issuers to raise concerns about the txns usually brought to attention by the card holders
		- acquirer receives those concerns and works with the merchants to resolve them
- visaNet sits bw issuer and acquirer
	- it is not one of the parties in the model
	- has a contractual relationship with the issuer and acquirer
		- not with the cardholder or merchant
	- payment nw brings these four parties together
	- what does the payment nw do?
		- facilitates authorization, clearance and settlement
			- auth: request to put the charge on the cardholder's account
			- clearing: process of sending the data that the issuer needs to prepare the cardholder's statement
			- settlement: process of payment from issuer to acquirer
		- sets global standards for txns to be able to be processed anywhere in the world
		- develops products and accelerates acceptance of card products
		- provides risk management tools
