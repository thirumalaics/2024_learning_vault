- dev perspective
	- writes code that gets deployed to a server
	- server: computer that handles requests from another computer
	- server requires persistent storage to store the app's data
		- we need external storage sys
		- server's built in storage is limited
		- storage is connected through nw
- from a user's perspective, they request the server for data
	- when multiple users request, there will be bottleneck
	- straightforward way to deal with server bottleneck is scaling
		- vertical or horizontal
	- one problem with horizontal scaling is deciding which server should serve the request
		- that is where the load balancer comes in
		- distributes the requests equally
- it is also possible that our server talks to other servers for different purposes
- logging from the server should be redirected to a logging service to better track activity
- we also need metrics to track what is happening with our server
	- some metrics can be derived from the logging service
	- but not all metrics can be sourced from logs, hence we need a separate system that takes care of tracking logs
- metrics system feeds into an alerting service which sends us a push notification
- if the above components are running in different systems, network comes into picture
