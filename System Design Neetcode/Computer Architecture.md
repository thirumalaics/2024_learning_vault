- computers are built with transistors
## Components
- disk
	- primary storage device
	- data remains intact irrespective of the state of the machine(turned on or off)
	- byte is 8 bits
	- bit is the smallest unit of information in computers, expressed as 0 or 1
	- HDD collects more wear and tear because of a moving piece inside
		- wear and tear slows them down over time
	- SSD relies on reading and writing data electronically(similar to RAM)
- RAM
	- relatively smaller in size when compared to disk
	- expensive, faster
	- holds any variable that our program has created and apps that we are running
	- volatile memory
	- RAM and disk do not directly comms with each other
		- CPU to facilitate data transfer bw them
- CPU
	- intermediary bw RAM and disk
	- when we write code and run it, the code is translated into a set of binary instructions stored in RAM
		- which component does this translation?
			- compiler ig
		- The CPU reads and executes these instructions, which may involve manipulating data stored in RAM or disk
	- all computations occur within CPU
		- fetches instructions from the RAM, executes them
		- CPU executes a program that is stored as a sequence of machine language instructions in main memory
		- follows fetch and execute cycle
	- CPU can (read/write) from/to disk and RAM
	- CPU contains cache
		- extremely fast memory
	- speed wise: cache > RAM > Disk
		- cache is mainly used as a substitute for the RAM
		- the data that gets into cache is chosen intelligently
- Caches
	- Kbs to 10s of MBs of data
	- whenever a read operation is requested, the cache is checked before the RAM and the disk
	- if data requested is in the cache and is unchanged since the last time it was accessed, it will be fetched from the cache
	- aka SRAM
- moore's law states that every two years, the number of transistors in a CPU double and the cost tend to halve
