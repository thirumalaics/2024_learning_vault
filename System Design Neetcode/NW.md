- IP addr: 32 bit int
	- 12 digits split into 4 parts
	- 4 billion unique IP addresses
- IPv6 addresses the limitation of IPv4
	- 128 bit
- each message sent should have sender and receiver IP addr details
- Internet protocol
	- rules of sending data over the internet
- every packet has a reserved amount of space for the md called the header
	- IP packet
- sending huge data requires us to break them up
	- how it will be reassembled in the receiver?
		- in IP, it is not possible
		- IP does not provide the ability to reorder
	- that is where TCP comes in, it solves this problem and many other probs
		- Transport Control Protocol
	- When using TCP, the packet will have an extra TCP header(in addition to IP header)
	- TCP header includes sequence number to allow reassembling
	- IP header helps in data being transferred bw systems
	- TCP header helps in reassembling data the is received
	- the data portion of the packet would contain would contain the HTTP request or response detail
	- IP is concerned with Network layer
	- TCP is concerned with the Transport layer
	- HTTP is app layer

## Public v Private
- client machine does not necessarily need a public IP
	- bunch of machines are connected to a nw through a device such as router
	- routers have their own public IP
	- this public IP can be used for requests and responses
	- a private IP is assigned with the nw created by the router
	- which each machine in the nw can use to comms
		- this comms can be further constrained using other techs like firewall etc..
- static v Dynamic
	- static IP important for a server
	- dynamic IP is possible for servers and it is made possible using dynamic domain name resolution
- ports
	- 16 bit value for a machine
	- uniquely identifies a connection endpoint
	- at a sw level, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process
	- 127.0.0.1 - local host : used to point to self
	- only single app for a single port

## TCP and UDP
- TCP/IP, TCP runs on top of IP
- IP is barebone
- TCP adds enhancements such as ordering
	- adds reliability
		- ex: missed packets of data are resent
	- not possible with UDP
- TCP establishes a two way connection channel bw the two systems using a 3-way handshake
	- overhead
	- adds latency to set up
	- slower
	- most protocols such as HTTP, SMTP are built on top of TCP
- UDP is user datagram protocol
	- datagram = packet
	- no establishing connections
	- no resending
	- data might arrive out of order
		- no correction from UDP
	- faster
	- useful for streaming

## DNS
- similar to contacts in phone
![[Pasted image 20240126192308.png]]
- `nslookup google.com`
- ICANN org that owns all the domain names
- from the above diagram the ISP is missing, ISP sits bw us and the DNS
- DNS record has it's types
	- one such is `A` - address record
		- means there is a string that points to IP addr
- client can cache IPAs so that it does not have to go through the cycle repeatedly
- for public servers, firewalls are configured to allow external traffic
- the component .com is called Top Level Domain
`protocol://subdomain.primarydomain.TLD/path`
`https://domains.google.com/get-started`
- www is not necessary anymore
- what is Application layer

## Application layer protocols
- client does not have to be an end-user
	- client is one that makes the request
	- client can be another server
	- servers are allowed to communicate with each other
- RPC - remote procedure call
	- way that machines can communicate with each other separated by a nw
	- executing code over the nw
	- makes it look like the code is in local to the client
	- nw calls also fall under this term
- HTTP
	- protocol of the internet
	- IP - for moving data across the nw
	- TCP - adds reliability to IP
	- both of the above are bare bone structures that we need to build apps
	- app layer(HTTP) protocol built on top of the above
	- we have control over only http
	- request response protocol
		- under the hood TCP connection is set up
	- no state management bw the client and server
	- https is a variation of http
	- every request has 2 comps
		- header and body
	- 3 types of headers
		- general
			- URL that we request
			- request method
		- request headers
- GET, POST, PUT(UPDATE), DELETE
	- GET request does not have a body, so any extra information should be embedded in the URL
- HTTPS(Hyper Text Transfer protocol with SSL(Secure Socket Layer)) 
	- SSL came b4 TLS(Transport Layer Security)
		- SSL is outdated, but still the term is used with TLS
	- SSL/TLS encrypts anything that we send over HTTP
- Websocket protocol can fill in the gaps of HTTP

- polling can be implemented by HTTP
	- we send a request for all the twitch stream messages as of some time, we get all the messages as of that time as one response, the connection closes
		- this is repeated as needed and this is polling
	- how do we time the polling?
	- but we cannot keep polling every one second using HTTP, because it is TCP and TCP comes with the over head of 3 way handshake
	- websocket protocol solves this
- websocket
	- first we call websocket handshake:
		- client sends a HTTP request to establish a websocket connection
		- that request is responded with status 101, means the connection is upgraded to websocket connection
	- after this a persistent connection is established bw the server and the client
	- this allows us to send info in both directions
	- the server pushes all the infor when needed
	- less expensive than HTTP
	- there is a state established bw the client and the server
- HTTP does not do bidirectional communication
	- not until HTTP2, which introduces streaming and makes websocket obsolete
	- but still websocket protocol is widespread
