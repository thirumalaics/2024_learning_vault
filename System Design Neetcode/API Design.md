- API design is concerned about surface level aspects and not implementation
	- how we are going to interact
	- what actions are possible
	- similar to defining a fns, ex args and return type
- why api design is important: 
	- because when creating a public api, it will be consumed by all
	- so any update will cascade changes to clients
- what if we want to introduce a change that will break existing api calls?
	- that is where versioning is used
	- versioning of the API is used to introduce changes or new designs so that there remains a version that does not break the status quo
	- the version of API that we hit is usually signified in the URL
- does the server create certain fields for every request?
	- it can be but it is implementation detail
	- these fields can be created before persisting the details in database
	- for example in the tweet creation use case, when the user sends out a request to create a tweet - the server creates fields like tweet id, createdAt etc..
- since GET request does not have any body, where would I be able to provide pagination details?
	- as a URL or query parameter
	- `https://api.twitter.com/v1.0/users/:id/tweets?limit=10&offset=0`
	- these query parameters are usually optional
- what is URL parameter?
- what is query parameter?
- is it a good practice to design an endpoint that will create a resource with a GET request?
	- no
	- GET requests are supposed to be idempotent
	- for the same input parameters, irrespective of how many times the end point is hit, it should have the same outcome
	- but there is no hard restriction that stops us from doing that, just that it is bad practice
- why is it that the get request is assumed/supposed to be idempotent?
	- for caching
	- by default GET requests are cached
- is it possible for a single endpoint to handle different HTTP methods?
	- yes
	- depends on how the server is designed
	- in the real world, same endpoint handles different methods differently
	- server code distinguishes what to do based on the HTTP method and sometimes based on the parameters
- what is pagination token?
	- returned by the get request
	- keeps track of how many elements we have seen so far
	- we pass this as part of the consecutive get request to offset the first x elements which were shown as a result of the first GET request
