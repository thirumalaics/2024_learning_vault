- API design is concerned about surface level aspects and not implementation
	- how we are going to interact
	- what actions are possible
	- similar to defining a fns, ex args and return type
- why api design is important: 
	- because when creating a public api, it will be consumed by all
	- so any update will cascade changes to clients
