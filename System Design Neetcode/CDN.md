- content delivery network
	- way to cache static data closer to end users
- origin server
	- original source of web content
	- where our website/application resides, hosting files like: 
		- html, css, js, images, videos, app code etc
	- when a user makes a request, if no caching is involved, that request is sent directly to the origin server, which generates and serves the content
- CDN server
	- geographically distributed nw of servers that caches and delivers content
	- content must be static like images, videos, scripts to users from a location close to them
	- faster load times due to proximity of server
	- reduced load on the origin
	- high availability and reliability
	- when a user makes a request, CDN checks if it has a cached copy of the content
		- if it does, it serves it directly - cache hit
		- if not, it forwards the request to the origin server, caches the response, and serves it to the user
- Push CDN
- Pull CDN
- 3: 40
- why app code cannot be put into CDN?
