- move data
- store data
- transform data
- design choices are expensive to correct
- design is about tradeoffs, no single correct ans
	- how to compare/measure the tradeoffs
- one important measurement is availability
	- uptime/(uptime + downtime)
- availability is used to define SLO
	- Service level objectives = target for the app/design
	- SLA diff from SLO
	- SLA = SLO + extra stuff
	- SLA is what the customer can expect and what will be the consequences when it is not met
- vertically scaling can improve availability but not the reliability
- redundancy enables fault tolerance which in turn enables reliability
- throughput
	- amount of data we can handle over some period of time
- horizontally scaling data might be complicated
	- some data stored in some db
	- when adding redundance, keeping all the dbs in sync is complicated
- latency: amount of time it takes for an operation to complete
- lowering latency helps increasing the throughput
- latency can be reduced by scaling
	- if not distributed, horizontal scaling can help
	- if distributed, vertical scaling can help
