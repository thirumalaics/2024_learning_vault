## YARN
- yet another resource negotiator
- cluster resource management system
- YARN was introduced in hadoop 2 to improve mapreduce implementation
	- but it is general enough to support other distributed computing paradigms as well
- YARN provides APIs for requesting and working with cluster resources
	- as users, we do not interact with these APIs
	- we work with higher-level APIs provided by distributed computing fws
	- these fws are built on YARN and hide the resource management details from the user

- there can be another layer that build on the fws shown in the above diagram
	- these fws run on MR, Spark or Tez or all three and they do not interact with YARN directly
	- ex: pig, Hive, Crunch

## Anatomy of a YARN application run
- YARN provides it's core services via two types of long-running daemons: 
	- a resource manager
	- node managers
- resource manager
	- one daemon per cluster
	- to manage the use of resources across the cluster
- node manager
	- one per node
	- to launch and manage containers
- container:
	- container is a collection of physical resources(CPU, memor, disk and nw) allocated to a specific task or application by YARN resource manager
	- they are ***resource allocation unit***
	- provide logical abstraction of resources
	- tasks running in containers are processes or threads managed by the host OS and not isolated virtualized envs
	- resource isolation is achieved via OS features such as Control groups
	- executes and application specific process with a constrained set of resources(mem, CPU and so on)
	- depending upon how YARN is configured, a container ***may be a unix process or a Linux Cgroup***
- what is a linux Cgroup?
	- kernel feature that provides a mechanism for managing and controlling the resource usage of a group of processes
	- using cgroup we can restrict amount of resources(CPU, memory, I/O etc.) that a group of processes can consume
	- allocate resources more favorable to certain groups over others
	- ensure one group of resources does not interfere with others by consuming excessive resources
	- Cgroups operate by organizing processes into hierarchical groups
	- each group is associated with a set of resource controllers(called subsystems) that enforce limits and monitor usage
	- subsystems in cgroups represent different types of resources that can be controlled
