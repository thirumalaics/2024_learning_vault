## Data governance continued
- MdM
	- it can describe the data asset in terms of the attributes it contains, who owns it, who has access
	- who accessed it, location, count, format etc..
- data quality
	- the data must be fit for the purpose they are intended for
	- data quality is measured along the dimensions like accuracy, completeness and consistency
	- in real estate, this can be compared to the condition and upkeep of the property
- data remediation
	- identifying and correcting data quality issues
	- maintains the value of the asset
- data usage
	- measurement of usage of asset
	- tracking and measuring how and by whom data is used in an org and to what extent data assets are adopted
- interoperability
	- property of a data asset to be exchanged and being compatible with different systems and applications
- data storage
	- physical and virtual storage capacity in databases, dwhs or data lakes
- data lifecycle management
	- managing data through various stages such as creation, storage, usage, archiving and disposal
- data integration
	- connecting data from different domains and sources, which involve tasks such as data cleansing, data mapping and data transformation
	- this ensures data from different systems can be used together

## Unity Catalog
- new governance solution of the db pf
- what is Unity catalog?
	- centralized governance solution across all our workspaces on any cloud
	- unify governance for all data and AI assets
		- files, tables, mlm and dashboards
		- based on SQL
	- with UC, we define our data access rules once across multiple workspaces and clouds
- how was the data governance handled before unity catalog?
	- users and groups were defined per workspace
	- access control was managed via the hive metastore within the workspace
	- ![[Pasted image 20240804094703.png]]
- how does UC handle DG?
	- UC sits out of the Workspace
	- accessed via UI called the ***account console***
		- users and groups are managed here and can be assigned to one or more workspaces
	- metastores are separated out of the workspace and managed through the account console 
		- they can be assigned to the workspaces
		- a metastore can be assigned to more than one workspace, enabling multiple workspace to share the same DBFS storage and the same access control lists
	- ![[Pasted image 20240804095348.png]]
- what is 3-level namespace in UC?
	- earlier tables or objects within a schema were addressed as: `schema.table`
	- UC introduces another lever: catalog - `catalog.schema.table`
	- ms is the top level logical container in UC
		- has md about objects and access control lists
	- catalogs are top level container for data objects in UC and forms the first part of the three level namespace
	- UCMS can have many catalogs as desired
	- catalogs contain schemas/dbs
- is HMS diff from UCMS?
	- UCMS is not the same as Hive MS
		- HMS is the default MS linked to each db ws
		- functionally might be similar to UCMS but UCMS offers improved security and advanced features
