## DB repo
- notebooks have some ***basic*** revision control built in
	- we cannot merge changes or create branches
	- the history can ***easily be deleted*** by the user
- db repo feature provide source code control by integrating with git providers
	- it can be thought of like GH desktop but not specific just to gh but to all git providers
	- GH is one of the git providers, it is based on git
- to use db repo, we must first configure git integration in the ws with one of the git providers
- git integration found in user - > user setting - > git integration
	- there will be a drop down for git provider
	- db has integration with several git providers like GH and Azure Devops
	- what is ***git provider***?
		- named service that hosts a source control model based on git
		- git based source control pfs are hosted in two ways:
			- cloud service hosted by the developing company
			- on premise service installed and managed by our own company on it's own hw
		- many git providers like GH, microsoft, git lab provide both cloud-based SaaS and on-premises git services
		- on prem solns are typically behind closed doors, inaccessible from the internet
	- to connect db to one of the git providers, we need our git service user name(if gh, then gh user name) and a personal access token
	- to get this PAT, go to github user -> developer settings -> PAT - > Tokens(Classic) -> Generate -> Classic
		- while creating we can specify the expiration date, scope(repo/wf)
		- in the video, he chose repo scope but there was no place to enter the repo
		- does this mean, with the token I can access all the repos the user has access to? and only the repos not wfs?
	- copy paste the PAT, this will integrate db and gh account
	- each db repo maps to a git repo
		- in order to set up a repo at db end, first create a repo in GH
		- once created, copy the clone link
		- in db, repos tab -> add repo -> paste the link -> submit
		- now we will have a gh desktop like set up in db from where we can manage the repo
			- very similar i/f as gh desktop 
		- we can clone notebooks from a workspace into the repos that we have created
		- nb in ws inherently have a clone option, which we can use to add notebooks to repos in the repo section
