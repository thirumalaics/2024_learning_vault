## Unity catalog
- as per official doc
- what is UC?
	- fine-grained DG soln for data and AI on the DB pf
	- central place to govern and secure our data
- what are the features provided by UC?
	- the following definitions are from my understanding
	- ***data lineage***: metadata that describes how the data came into picture, what are the sources involved and how many levels of transformation were needed
	- ***access control***: ability to restrict and control the user and group accesses to the data assets
		- ***SQL based***
		- control across different levels: schemas, catalogs, tables and views
	- ***discovery***: ability to find specific data asset from a corpus of data assets using metadata
		- UC allows to tag and document data assets
		- search interface provided
	- ***auditing***: tracking the usage of data including who, when, how and what(operation was performed)
		- UC records access to our data
	- centralized, hence define once secure everywhere
	- ***system tables***: ability to query data access md, lineage


## UC Object model
- where is the metadata stored?
	- md of different workspaces, which can be across clouds, are stored in a centralized ***metastore***
- what is the hierarchy observed in UC?
	- three level hierarchy
	- hierarchy of db objects in any UCMS is divided into three levels
	- ![[Pasted image 20240805081359.png]]
- in the above diagram what are the other entities that exist in the same level as catalog?
	- they are called non-data securable objects
- what is non-data securable objects?
	- these are non data objects
	- UC governs access to data using the following securable objects #doubt
- what is a metastore in UC and what is stored in it?
	- top-level container for md in UC
	- in this MS, the following are stored
		- md about data and ai assets
		- permissions that govern the data and ai assets
	- for a workspace to use UC, it needs to have a UCMS attached
- should we have only one UCMS?
	- recommendation is to have one UCMS for every region in which we have WSs
	- UCMS is automatically created when we create a WS in a region
	- for older accounts, Admin must create a MS and assign the the WSs of a region to this MS
		- no mention of whether the MS should be created within the same region but it makes sense to do so
- what are catalogs in the UC three-level hierarchy?
	- highest level of data organization
	- registered in a UCMS
	- resembles projects in GCP(i say so)
	- catalogs mirror organizational units or sw dev scope
	- catalogs provide physical and logical isolation of data
	- each catalog must represent a separate group of data that comes
		- like prod, dev etc - separate group of data
	- each catalog must also have it's own data access limits defined as this definition flows through the objects within the catalog
		- ex: dev will have lenient data access provided
	- typically each catalog has its own managed storage location to store managed tables and volumes
		- physical data isolation
	- we choose to provide a default storage location for catalogs that dont have a managed storage location of their own
	- this does not restrict us to provide a storage at the schema level
- what are schemas?
	- logical grouping of data objects
	- child of catalog
- what can be the contents of a schema?
	- tables, views, volumes, models
- what level of isolation is provided for schemas in a catalog?
	- we can physically isolate schemas in a catalog by specifying a managed storage location for the schema
	- if not provided data resides in the catalog's managed storage location
		- if this also not provided, then metastore's managed storage location
	- data isolation for external tables and volumes depends on where we store them
