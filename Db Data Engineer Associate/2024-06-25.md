## Delta Lake Contd

- update invalidates x number of files, since it copies and updates the x files there is no change in the num of files before and after
- review table history using `DESCRIBE HISTORY table;`
	- each row in this table represents a diff version
	- this table includes the predicates used as well
	- for example in the update statement I had used name like, that condition is included in the respective row for the version of table after update
- when I cloned the cluster, data in it was also cloned but the data was not added to the catalog -> this is a stupid statement as dbfs is not a filesystem that stores data within the cluster
	- data resides in db managed storage
- each txn results in a new json file being written to the delta log folder
	- crc files present along with the json are checksum files

- contents of the json file
	- display function did not output a df

## Advanced Delta Lake features
- time travel
	- query older versions of the data
		- can be done in two diff ways
			- using a timestamp: `SELECT * from my_table TIMESTAMP AS Of "2019-01-01"`
			- using a version number
				- `SELECT * from my_table VERSION AS of 36`
				- `SELECT * from my_table@v36`
	- roll back versions made possible by time travel
		- `RESTORE TABLE my_table TO TIMESTAMP AS of "2019-01-01";`
		- `RESTORE TABLE my_table TO VERSION AS of 36`
- compacting small files and indexing
	- `OPTIMIZE my_table;`- compacting small files
	- indexing - colocate column information
	- `OPTIMIZE my_table ZORDER BY column_name`
		- aka ZORDER Indexing
		- similar records in the same files
		- similarity determined by the column data
		- ![[Pasted image 20240625095844.png]]
		- this helps in reducing the amount of data to be read
			- some files can be ignored as they might not contain data within the range of values we are looking for
		- while querying with the timestamp, we must provide the exact timestamp value when the version was created
		- ![[Pasted image 20240625101226.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20240625101310.png]]
		- RESTORE TABLE employees TO VERSION AS of 2; ![[Pasted image 20240625101854.png]]
		- delete and restore commands as well are logged as part of the history
		- ![[Pasted image 20240625102012.png]]
- vacuum
	- clean unused data files in the table data dir
		- uncommitted files
		- files that do not contribute to the latest table state
		- VACUUM command - provides garbage collection
		- `VACUUM table_name [retention period]` 
		- default retention period: 7 days
		- files older than this value are deleted
		- removes all files from the table directory that are not managed by Delta, as well as data files that are no longer in the latest state of the txn log for the table within the given retention period
		- this command will skip all dirs that begin with an underscore(\_)
		- once we vacuum, we cannot time travel back older than the retention period as the files will be deleted
