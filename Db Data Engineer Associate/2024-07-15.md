- ```CREATE TABLE customers as SELECT * from json.`${dataset.bookstore}/customer-json` ```
	- the above ctas statement creates a managed delta table
	- important to keep in mind that the schema is inferred automatically from the query results
		- in the above case the schema is all string
- describe detail statement only supported for tables, not for views
	- DESCRIBE extended can be used instead
	- the output just displays the schema for a view
	- ![[Pasted image 20240715094135.png]]
- the screenshot above also shows creating a temp view using USING and options
	- table created on top of this view with a CTAS creates a managed table
- variables like ${dataset.bookstore} are replaced with their values when they are enclosed with "" or \`\` or ''
- we can give the path to data using path option
- is it mandatory to give schema while creating a ***external delta table***?
	- it is possible to create an external delta table without providing schema
	- it is also possible that we can use path option instead of location
- is it mandatory to provide schema while creating an external provide table(using USING)?
	- #doubt
## Writing to tables
- syntax to insert and update records in delta tables
- delta tech supports ACID guarantees to delta tables
- prefer overwriting tables instead of deleting and recreating
- overwriting is faster as it does not have to list directory recursively and delete any files
	- it is an atomic operation
	- concurrent queries can still read the table while we are overwriting it
	- but that cannot be the case when deleting I guess
- first method to accomplish complete overwrite: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
	- this can also be used with select statements
	- CRAS statements completely replace the contents of a table each time they execute
	- CR statement does not erase history
	- the CR is added as a record into the history as it is just an overwrite
	- ``CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders as SELECT * from parquet.${dataset.bookstore}/orders``
	- ![[Pasted image 20240715101403.png]]
- another way to overwrite: ```INSERT OVERWRITE orders SELECT * from parquet.`${dataset.bookstore}/orders` ```
	- the above statement gives identical output as the above
	- slight diff when compared to CRAS:
		- it can overwrite only existing tables and not creating a new one like our CR
		- it can overwrite only the new records that match the current table, schema
			- hence it is a safer tech for overwriting without the risk of modifying the table schema
			- if the query has extra columns, an exception is raised
	- as expected this goes into the history
