## DB SQL
- we must be connected to SQLWH to be able to query
- are catalogs, databases and tables tied to a SQLWH?
- can the result of a query be added to the dashboard?
	- SQL results can be added to dashboards
		- what this meant in the video: no visualization was created when he added this dashboard. just the results were added to the dashboard
- can queries be scheduled in databricks?
	- yes, in the query editor itself we have an option to schedule queries
	- we can also set a schedule for the query to refresh the results automatically
- what are saved queries in dbsql?
	- similar to views but they are not stored in the db
		- i think this is pretty accurate
	- saved queries are prompt for a name from us
	- present in queries menu in the sidebar:
		- we can see the saved queries
		- the saved queries can be used to setup alerts
	- at the time of writing, no doc defining saved query
- are saved queries different from scheduled queries?
	- yes
	- when saving a query we do not have to provide any schedule
	- when scheduling a query we do not have to give a name
- what are alerts in dbsql and how to set them?
	- alerts in dbsql allow us to receive notification when a result field of our query meets a certain threshold
	- in the alerts menu we can create new alerts and select saved query
		- alerts need to have a name
		- Trigger when option can be set with a value column and a condition
			- ex: total_fare > 10000
		- only the top row value is considered for this condition check, so we may need to consider sorting or a query that returns one row
			- but there is no restriction that the query must return only one row
		- refresh interval can be set on the alert
- what are alert destinations?
	- alert destination is where the alerts are sent to
		- new alert destinations can be created
		- type of alert destinations: slack, pagerDuty, teams etc....

## Data object privileges
- how is access control implemented in DBSQL?
	- programmatically as well as using UI

- how to programmatically perform access control
	- allows us to programmatically grant, deny and revoke access to data object for a user or group of users
	- ```GRANT Privilege ON Object <object-name> TO <user or group>```
	- ```GRANT SELECT ON TABLE my_table TO user_1@company.com```
	- the SQL Statements can be run in the SQLEditor
- what are the different types of objects we can provide access to?
	- managing permissions for data objects

- what are the different privileges that we can provide to a user or group?
	- ![[Pasted image 20240802091353.png]]
- can anyone provide privileges to a user or group?
	- to grant privileges on an object, we need to be either databricks administrator or the object owner
	- databricks administrator can grant access on all objects in the catalog and in the underlying file sys
	- catalog owner can obviously provide access on objects under the catalog![[Pasted image 20240802091833.png]]
- what are the different programmatic operations for access control within db?
	- other operations for data governance:
		- GRANT
		- DENY
		- REVOKE
		- SHOW GRANTS
- all of these privileges are within the DBSQL(DWH)

- can databases be created in a custom location within the SQLDWH?
	- databases can be created and be given a location under dbfs like:
		- `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS FOR hr_db LOCATION 'dbfs:/mnt/demo/hr_db.db'`
- provide examples of the access control statement
	- `GRANT SELECT, USAGE, MODIFY, READ_METADATA, CREATE ON SCHEMA hr_db TO hr_team;`
	- for users to perform any operation on a db object, they must have an additional privilege: USAGE
	- `GRANT SELECT, USAGE, MODIFY, READ_METADATA, CREATE ON SCHEMA hr_db TO 'hr_team_member_new@company.com';`
	- `SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA hr_db;`

- where in UI can we perform access control?
	- in addition to SQL based access control, there is a UI called Data/Data Explorer within the SQL persona which provides access control
		- allows users and admins to navigate different data objects like dbs, tables and views etc
		- also allows providing permissions
		- UI for access management
- can the object owner be changed?
	- object owner can be changed at least in UI
		- owner can be individual or a group
- there is a default group called Admins: all workspace admins are present here
- what are the limitations of UI based access control?
	- ANY FILE object cannot be granted access from the UI
		- at the time of writing
- does DBSQL track queries against data objects?
	- DB captures query history against DBSQL objects
		- under Query history menu in SQL persona
