- does cloning a cluster copy the data in it as well?
	- yes contents of dbfs copied as well
	- but the tables and schemas created do not directly appear as part of the catalog
- the following rummb directory was created by db
![[Pasted image 20240701092305.png]]

- DESCRIBE DATABASE statement to display md on the schema level
![[Pasted image 20240701093025.png]]
- DESCRIBE DETAIL statement is only for table/view
- DESCRIBE EXTENDED command can be used on tables or views to display more md on the entity
	- this table includes column level details as well
- tables created, without the location keyword, under dbs with diff location than `/user/hive/warehouse` are Managed tables only
![[Pasted image 20240701093423.png]]
- schemas with the same name cannot be created even if they are tried with different locations
- while creating an external table, if we give a path that does not exist the entire path is created
	- the table files and delta_log directory created under the last folder in the path
	- the last folder name does not have to be same as the table name but it is a good practice to have it same
	- in the following picture, the insert and create were run in diff cells that's y output not right for the first cell
![[Pasted image 20240701094305.png]]
- two external tables with the same name but diff locations cannot exist
- creating a external table with the path identical to the path of a managed table(within the corresponding db folder) will create the table as external only
	- so providing the location command during the create table, irrespective of the valid path given, will create the table as external only

- DESCRIBE DATABASE EXTENDED statement provides more md on the db, but I do not see it useful
	- ![[Pasted image 20240701095151.png]]
- .db suffix is usually used to differentiate it from table folders
- semi colon is necessary when typing up many sql statements in a cell
	- semi colon was not mandatory for the last statement in a cell
- external tables can be created on folders which are already sourcing other external tables
	- check the same for a managed table folder
