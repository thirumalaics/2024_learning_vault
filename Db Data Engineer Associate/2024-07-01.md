- does cloning a cluster copy the data in it as well?
	- yes
	- but the tables and schemas created do not directly appear as part of the catalog

- DESCRIBE DETAIL statement is only for table/view
- DESCRIBE EXTENDED command can be used on tables or views to display more md on the entity
	- this table includes column level details as well
- tables created, without the location keyword, under dbs with diff location than `/user/hive/warehouse` are Managed tables only

- schemas with the same name cannot be created even if they are tried with different locations
- while creating an external table, if we give a path that does not exist the entire path is crated
	- the table files and delta_log directory created under the last folder in the path
	- the last folder name does not have to be same as the table name but it is a good practice to have it same
