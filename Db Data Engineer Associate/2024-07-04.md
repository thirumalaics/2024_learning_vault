## Views
- in DB, virtual table with no physical data
- logical query against source tables
- types of views in DB
	- (stored) Views
		- persistent objects
		- `CREATE VIEW view_name as query`
		- once created, we can query the view as if it were a standard table
		- dropped only when `DROP VIEW` is run
	- Temporary Views
		- session scoped view
		- tied to spark session
		- `CREATE TEMP VIEW view_name as Query`
		- when spark session is created in DB
			- several scenarios where SS is created
			- when opening a new notebook, spark session comes out of the box
				- true
			- detaching and reattaching a notebook to a cluster
			- installing a python package
				- which leads to restarting the python interpreter
			- restarting the cluster
	- Global Temporary Views
		- it is tied to the cluster
		- as long as the cluster is running, any notebook attached to the cluster can access its global temporary view
		- Global temporary views are added to a cluster's temporary db called global_temp
			- we need to use the global_temp db qualifier
		- `CREATE GLOBAL TEMP VIEW view_name as query`
		- `select * from global_temp.view_name`
		- dropped when cluster is restrated
- `SHOW TABLES` statement displays both views(temp and stored) and tables available in the current db
	- global temp views are not displayed because they are from global temp db
- we can
