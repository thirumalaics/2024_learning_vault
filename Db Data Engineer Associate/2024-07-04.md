## Views
- in DB, virtual table with no physical data
- logical query against source tables
- types of views in DB
	- (stored) Views
		- persistent objects
		- `CREATE VIEW view_name as query`
		- once created, we can query the view as if it were a standard table
		- dropped only when `DROP VIEW` is run
	- Temporary Views
		- session scoped view
		- tied to spark session
		- `CREATE TEMP VIEW view_name as Query`
		- when spark session is created in DB
			- several scenarios where SS is created
			- when opening a new notebook, spark session comes out of the box
				- true
			- detaching and reattaching a notebook to a cluster
			- installing a python package
				- which leads to restarting the python interpreter
			- restarting the cluster
		- tmp views are not available after a session restart
	- Global Temporary Views
		- it is tied to the cluster
		- ***as long as the cluster is running***, any notebook attached to the cluster can access its global temporary view
		- after cluster restart, we cannot access the global temp views
		- Global temporary views are added to a cluster's temporary db called global_temp
			- we need to use the global_temp db qualifier
		- `CREATE GLOBAL TEMP VIEW view_name as query`
		- `select * from global_temp.view_name`
		- dropped when cluster is restrated
- `SHOW TABLES` statement displays both views(temp and stored) and tables available in the current db
	- global temp views are not displayed because they are from global temp db

	- to show tables and views in a diff db than the current db:

		- surprisingly we can see the temp view in the global temp db as well
		- temp views are shown in every SHOW TABLES output
	- when I tried show tables from a diff nb, we can see the stored views and tables, in global_temp we can see the gbl tmp view we created in a diff nb
		- remember that both notebooks were created within the same cluster
		- ![[Pasted image 20240704095649.png]]
- we can use If not exists clause when creating a temp view or global temp view
- we are not able to see the temp view or global temp view in the catalog section:
	- only stored view is available to view

## Querying files
- querying data files directly
	- using sparksql
	- SELECT * from file_format.\`/path/to/file\`
	- this works well with self-describing formats that have well-defined schema like parquet and JSON
		- not good with CSVs
		- the path can direct to a single file or a we can use wildcards to match multiple or read the whole dir
- extract files as raw contents
- configure options of external sources
	- using spark sql to configure options for extracting data from external sources
- use CTAS statements to create Delta Lake tables
