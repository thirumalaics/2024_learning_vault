- created a ext table on top of location of a managed table
	- the content of the external table was empty even though the managed table had record
	- this is because I gave the location of the managed table wrong, even though the table name has mixed casing, the folder created for the managed table is ***all lower case***

	- When I re created the external table by droppin and creating on top of the right location, the data was the same in both and insert to one table affected the other as well

		- the history for the managed and external table was the same as well
	- ![[Pasted image 20240702090811.png]]
	- for managed tables, the name of the folder created for the table is all lower case no matter what casing is found in the table name
	- the table name that we give is treated as case insensitive, as in the following ss I am able to query EEMP23 as EEmp23

- I was not able to create or replace an external table with a diff location


## Delta lake tables
- CTAS statements
	- to create Delta lake tables
	- full form: CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
	- `CREATE TABLE _ AS SELECT statement`
	- do not support manual schema declaration
		- they infer schema directly from the query results
	- additional options are available for CREATE TABLE statement and CTAS:
		- `CREATE TABLE new_table COMMENT "contains PII" PARTITIONED BY(city, birth_date) LOCATION '/some/path' as SELECT`
		- partition here happens similar to spark, folders and subfolders by the given columns
- table constraints
- cloning delta lake tables
