## Querying files contd.
- querying data files directly
	- SELECT * from json.\`/path/to/file_name.json\`
- extract files as raw contents
	- extract text files as raw strings
		- when working with text based files which include csv, tsv and txt format
		- SELECT * from text.\`/path/to/file\`
		- this extracts data as raw strings
			- raw strings treat the back slash char as a literal character
		- this can be useful when input data could be corrupted
		- later custom text parsing functions can be used to extract values from text files
	- extract files as raw bytes
		- when we need binary rep of files content, when dealing with images and unstructured data
		- SELECT * from binaryFile.\`/path/to/file\`
