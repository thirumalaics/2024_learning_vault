## Querying files contd.
- querying data files directly
	- SELECT * from json.\`/path/to/file_name.json\`
- extract files as raw contents
	- extract text files as raw strings
		- when working with text based files which include csv, tsv and txt format
		- SELECT * from text.\`/path/to/file\`
		- this extracts data as raw strings
			- raw strings treat the back slash char as a literal character
		- this can be useful when input data could be corrupted
		- later custom text parsing functions can be used to extract values from text files
	- extract files as raw bytes
		- when we need binary rep of files content, when dealing with images and unstructured data
		- SELECT * from binaryFile.\`/path/to/file\`
- Configure options for external sources
	- registering tables from files
	- the above select statements can be used as part of CTAS in DLH
		- ```CREATE TABLE table_name AS SELECT * from file_format.`/path/to/file` ```
	- as CTAS does not support manual schema definition, this method of table definition works well with external sources with well-defined schema
		- such as parquet files and tables
	- CTAS statements do not support defining additional file options
	- significant limitation when trying to ingest data from CSV files
	- for CSVs it is helpful to provide OPTIONS and for this we can make use of USING keyword
		- ```CREATE TABLE table_name (col_name1 col_type1,...) USING external_data_source_type OPTIONS(key1=val1,key2=val2,...) LOCATION = path```
		- this command always creates an external table unlike the above 
		- the table is just a reference to the files
		- there is no data moving during table creation
		- we are just pointing to files stored in an external location
		- the format of the files are left unchanged, which means we are creating a non delta table
		- `CREATE TABLE table_name (col_name1 col_type1,...) USING CSV OPTIONS (header="true", delimiter=";") LOCATION = path`
		- as we can see here we can define the schema unlike CTAS as this is not a CTAS
		- creating a table using JDBC connection to refer to data in an external SQL DB
			- `CREATE TABLE table_name (col_name1 col_type1,...) USING JDBC OPTONS(url="jdbc:sqlit://hostname:port", dbtable="username", password="pwd")`
		- this is not a delta table
		- performance and features of Delta lake are no more guaranteed
			- ex: time travel, guarantee that we are always reading the most recent version of data
	- is the delta log table created for an external table
