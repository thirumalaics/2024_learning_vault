- what are the constraints in the data sharing solutions?
	- provider might have on dwhing product or data store product
	- recipient might have to deploy the same product before even trying to get any data
	- once wh or the data storage is deployed in the receiver side, the analyst would export the data to their data science tool, such as pandas or tableau
	- as we can see, deploying the same data storage solution can be time consuming and costly
		- then there is an extra cost of reading from the storage
- how does delta sharing improve this situation above?
	- with delta sharing , data users can directly connect to the shared data through pandas, tableau or dozens of other systems that implement the open protocol
		- no need to deploy a specific pf first
- how does [delta sharing](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/05/26/introducing-delta-sharing-an-open-protocol-for-secure-data-sharing.html) works?
	- REST protocol
	- securely shares access to part of a cloud dataset
	- relies on modern cloud storage systems, S3, ADLS, GCS to reliably transfer large datasets
	- DS allows us to share existing tables or parts(specific table versions of partitions)
		- the data is stored in cloud storage
		- in delta lake format
		- a delta lake table is collection of parquet files
		- it is easy to convert a [parquet table to delta table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/delta-convert-to-delta.html) in place
	- data provider runs a sharing server that implements delta sharing protocol and manages access for recipients
	- data recipients need any one of the delta sharing clients that supports the protocol
		- there are open source connectors for pandas, Apache spark, Rust and python
	- ![[Pasted image 20240809090428.png]]
	1. recipient client authenticates to the sharing server(using a bearer token or other method) and asks to query a specific table. 
		- the client can also provide filters on the data as a hint to read subset of data
	2. server verifies whether the client is allowed to access data, logs the request and then determines which data to send back
		- subset of data in cloud storage systems
	3. to transfer data, server generates a short-lived pre-signed url that allows client to read parquet from cloud provider
		- no streaming from server
		- since cloud provider involved transfer can happen in parallel and at massive bandwidth
- what are the different identities in UC?
	- users: identified by email address
		- account administrator
	- service principles: identified by application ids
		- service principles with administrative privilege
	- groups: grouping users and service principles
		- nested groups
