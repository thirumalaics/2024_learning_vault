1. What is the dull and persistent dissatisfaction you’ve learned to live with? Not the deep suffering but what you’ve learned to tolerate. (If you don’t hate it, you will tolerate it)
	- I feel I am not active in my work life, contributing new things
	- learning does not feel interesting and it does not pull me in, like the MCP stuff pulled me in
	- not meditating daily
2. What do you complain about repeatedly but never actually change? Write down the three complaints you’ve voiced most often in the past year.
	1. eating habits: eating as necessary to satiate. not overeating and cutting down sugar
	2. meditating habit: meditating every day
	3. contributing without being prompted at work, building the reputation as a contributor
	4. spending habits: curbing spendings
3. For each complaint: What would someone who watched your behavior (not your words) conclude that you actually want?
	- eating habits: wanting the both: a great body and taste. maybe overeating and sugar intake to compensate some inner dissatisfaction?
	- meditating habit: not important enough. the very act of not meditating on a daily basis conveys that I really do need it. I want to continue the way I am, so that I do not have to put in efforts at something that has always escaped me. I want instant results, whereas meditation requires patience. I want constant distraction..
	- an average corporate employee who wants the comfort of salary and comfort of leisure time. 
	- luxury
4. What truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit to someone you deeply respect?
