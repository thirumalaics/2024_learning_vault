[python - What is the difference between a string and a byte string? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6224052/what-is-the-difference-between-a-string-and-a-byte-string)
- to store anything in disk we need to encode it, convert it into bytes
- examples of encodings are MP3, WAV, JPEG etc...
- these encodings are ways to represent audio, images and text
- in python specifically, a byte string is a sequence of bytes
	- it is not human-readable
	- under the hood every string needs to be converted to a byte string before it can be stored
- a character string is a human readable sequence of characters
	- some encodings that can convert a string to byte string: ASCII, UTf-8
- when we print byte strings, py will decode and print it with a b in front of the string to indicate it is a byte string
- there are many reasons why there are many encodings for the same type of data
	- main question is "how many characters we need to display(encode)?"
	- for just plain english, ASCII is enough, but if we need to display annotated characters, we need better encodings

## JSON, XML, and Binary Variants Contd
- JSON, XMLs have good support for unicode character strings(i.e. human-readable text)
	- they do not support binary strings(sequence of bytes without a character encoding)
	- people get around this limitation by encoding the binary data as text using Base64
		- what is base64?
			- it is an encoding
			- when we want to send some binary data across a nw, it is not done by streaming bits and bytes across the wire in raw format
			- because some media are made for streaming text
			- in short the media might interpret it incorrectly and perform unwanted actions
			- so to get around this, binary data is encoded into characters
			- base64 is one of these types of encodings
			- why 64? these are characters that are expected to be present in many character sets
			- we can be confident that our data's not going to end up on the other side of the wire uncorrupted
	- the schema is then used to indicate that the value should be interpreted as Base64-encoded
