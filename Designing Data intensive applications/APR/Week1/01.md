### Language-Specific formats contd
- problems with language specific encoding libs
	- in order to restore data in the same object types, the decoding process needs to be able to instantiate arbitrary classes ^^^^
		- source of security problems
			- if an attacker can get our app to decode an arbitrary byte sequence, they can instantiate arbitrary classes
			- this allows them to remotely execute arbitrary code
	- versioning the data is often an afterthought^^^^
		- these libs are intended for quick and easy encoding of data
		- they neglect forward and backward compatibility
	- inefficient in terms of
		- CPU time taken to encode or decode
		- size of the encoded structure
		- ex: Java's built-in serialization: bad performance and bloated encoding
- in general it is better to use builtin serialization for temporary requirements

### JSON, XML and binary variants
- these are standardized encodings
- can be written and read by many prog langs
- CSV also is a language independent format
	- less powerful
- XML - verbose and unnecessarily complicated
- JSON is popular because of 
	- its built-in support in web browsers(subset of JS)
	- simplicity
- all these three are textual formats^^^^
	- somewhat human readable
	- different syntaxes
- Precision in SQL = number of digits in a number
- scale in SQL = number of digits to the right of the decimal point
- Precision(in computing): the number of digits that a numerical data type can represent accurately
	- floating-point numbers can only represent a certain number of decimal places accurately
	- beyond this, the values becomes approximations
		- leads to inaccuracies in calculations
- subtle problems involved with these formats:
	- a lot of ambiguity around the encoding of numbers
		- in XML and CSV we cannot distinguish bw a number and a string consisting of digits
			- we can distinguish only by referring to an external schema
		- JSON does not distinguish int and floating point but there is a distinction bw nums and strings
			- no precision specified
		- no precision is problem for large numbers
			- IEEE floating point numbers repr is a std for floating point computation
			- integers greater than 2^53 cannot be represented in IEEE 754
			- so such numbers become inaccurate when parsed in a language that uses the above repr(JS)
