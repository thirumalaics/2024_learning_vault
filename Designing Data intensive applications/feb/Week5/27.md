## The foundation: Datalog
- much older than SPARQL or Cypher
	- Datalog served as the foundation for the above two query langs
- used in few data systems: datomic and cascalog
- Datalog's data model is similar to TSM, generalized a bit
- (subject, predicate, object) is written as ***predicate(subject, object)***
	- properties and edges are treated the same as predicates
		- ex: name and type predicates below

- Cypher and SPARQL started straight away with selecting what needs to be output, but Datalog takes a small step at a time
- we define ***rules*** that tell the db about ***new predicates***
	- two new predicates defined above are `within_recursive` and `migrated`
	- these predicates are ***not triples stored in the db***
	- they are either ***derived*** from existing data or from other rules
	- rules can ***refer to other rules*** and can ***refer themselves recursively***
		- just like functions
- in rules
	- words that start with ***uppercase letter*** are ***variables***
	- predicates are matched like in Cypher and SPARQL
		- ex: name(Location, Name) matches triple name(namerica, 'North America')
		- Location and Name are variables
- a rule applies if the system can find a match for all predicates on the RHS of the :- operator
- if the rule applies, it is as though the lhs of the :- was added to the db 
	- with variables replaced by the values they matched
- datalog compatible and powerful for complex data

# CH3: Storage and Retrieval
- high-level ***db*** ***fnality***:
	- when given some data, it should store it
	- when asked again later, it should give data back
- data model - ***format*** in which we give the data
- query language: ***mechanism*** by which we ask for data
- this chapter deals with understanding ***how the db stores the data and how it finds the data***
	- we should understand this because, it helps us select a storage engine that is appropriate for our app
		- also to tune the storage engine
