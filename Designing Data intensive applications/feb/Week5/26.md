## Triple-stores and SPARQL
- mostly equivalent to the property graph model
	- different words, same ideas
- various tools and langs for triple-stores
- in a triple-store, all information is stored in the form of simple three-part statements: (subject, predicate, object)
	- ex: Jim likes apples (Jim, likes, apples)
- ***subject*** of a triple is always equivalent to a ***vertex*** in a graph
- ***object*** is one of two things
	- ***a value in a primitive datatype***, such as string or number
		- in that case, the ***predicate and object are equivalent to kvp*** on the subject vertex
		- ex: (lucy, age, 33) is {"age":33}
	- ***another vertex***, then the ***predicate*** is an ***edge***
		- subject is tail vertex, object is the head vertex, predicate is the label
		- ex: (lucy, marriedTo, alain) the subject(lucy) and object(alain) are both vertices, predicate marriedTo is the label of the edge that connects them
	- so far we have not seen a situation in which the predicate is a vertex
	- subject of one triple can be an object in another and vice versa
		- \_:idaho is one such example

- vertices of the graph are written as \_:someName
	- the someName does not mean anything outside of this file
		- they exist to give us an understanding of which triples refer to the same vertex
- when the predicate represents an edge, the object is a vertex ex: \_:idaho :within \_:usa
- when the predicate is a property then the object is a string literal: \_:usa :name "United States"
- in the following, semicolon is used to say multiple things about the same subject

### Semantic web
- triple-store data model is completely independent of the semantic web
- what is semantic web?
	- fundamentally an idea which proposes websites to publish information as machine-readable data for computers to read
		- basically ***store, structure and tag web pages*** in such a way that it can be ***read directly by computers***
- RDf(resource description fw) was intended as a mech for different web-sites to publish data in a consistent format
	- to represent interconnected data on the web

- I have excluded RDf
#### SPARQL
- acronym for "SPARQL Protocol and RDf Query Language"
- SPARQL is a query language for triple-stores using the RDf data model
- predates cypher, cypher is slightly inspired from SPARQL
![[Pasted image 20240226193330.png]]
- concise
- ***RDf does not distinguish bw properties and edges***, uses predicates for both
	- because of this, the ***same syntax for matching either***
- I think the / above is used to represent unnamed vertices
- in the following exp, the variable usa is bound to any vertex that has a name property whose value is the string "United States"
	- looks similar to the within edge matching above

#### Differences bw Graph and nw model
- in nwm, a db had a schema that specified which record type could be nested within which other record type
	- in gdb, there is no restriction
		- a vertex can have an edge to any other vertex
- in nwm, the only way to reach a particular record was traverse one of the access paths to it
	- in gdb, we can refer to any vertex by its unique ID, or we can use an index to find vertices with a particular value
- in nwm, the children of a record were an ordered set
	- the db had to maintain ordering which affected the storage layout and applications that inserted new records into the db had to worry about the positions of the new records
	- in the gdb, vertices and edges are not ordered
- in nwm, all queries were imperative and were at the mercy of schema change
	- in gdb, we have support for both imperative and declarative
