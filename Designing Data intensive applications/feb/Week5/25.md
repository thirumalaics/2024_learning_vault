## Cypher Contd
- there are several ways to execute the query ^09f6eb
	- scan all the people in the db, examining each person's birthplace and residence, and return only those people who meet the criteria
		- start with the person
	- start with two location vertices and work backward
		- if there is an index on the name property, we can probably efficiently find the two vertices representing the US and Europe
		- then we can proceed to find all locations in US and Europe by following all incoming WITHIN edges
		- finally, we can look for people who can be found through an incoming BORN_IN or LIVES_IN edge at one of the location vertices
- all these execution details would have been handwritten in case of imperative query lang

## Graph Queries in SQL
- can graph data, if put in a relational structure, can be queried using SQL?
	- yes, with complexity

 - the number of joins is not fixed in advance: because in graph query, we may need to traverse a variable number of edges before we find the vertex we are looking for
	 - for example, in lucy's case: her BORN_IN edge points to a state where as the LIVES_IN edge points to a City, this affects the number of edges need to traverse to find the country(2) and continent(4) respectively, hence affecting the number of joins required
	 - in short an edge may either directly point to a vertex we are looking for or may point to a vertex which will eventually lead us to the required vertex
	- this situation of not knowing how many edges to traverse is handled by :WITHIN\*0..
		- it means follow a WITHIN edge 0 or more times until we find what we are looking for
- SQL has something called ***recursive common table expressions***(WITH RECURSIVE)
	- which can help in expressing variable length traversal paths in a query
	- as seen in the following, it is clumsy
	- the following query replicates the second logic in [[25#^09f6eb]]
![[Pasted image 20240225120712.png]]
1. first find the vertex whose name property's value is US and make it the first element of the set of vertices in_usa
2. follow all incoming within edges from vertices in the in_usa set, and add the tail vertices to the same set until all incoming WITHIN edges have been visited
3. repeat the 1st and 2nd step for Europe
4. create a set of tail vertices(person type) whose BORN_IN edges point to at least one of the in_usa vertices as the head vertex
5. create a set of tail vertices(person type) whose LIVES_IN edges point to at least one of the in_europe vertices as the head vertex
6. intersect the set of people born in the USA(born_in_usa) with the set of people living in europe(lives_in_europe), by joining them

- the same query in Cypher takes 4 lines where as in SQL it takes 29 lines, this shows that different data models are designed to satisfy different use cases
