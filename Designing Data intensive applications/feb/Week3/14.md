## Maintainability
- majority of the cost of sw is in its ***on-going maintenance***
	- fixing bugs, keeping it's systems operational, investigating failures, adapting it to new pfs, modifying it for new use cases, repaying technical debts
	- technical debt is accrued work that is owed to an IT system
		- this is due to teams borrowing against quality by making sacrifices or taking short-cuts to meet delivery deadlines
- legacy system: information system that ***may be*** based on outdated tech, but is critical to day-to-day operations
	- ls can also mean the systems that were forced to do things they were never intended for
		- ex: airflow for data processing in pcln
	- from the use of the ls term in the book, I believe ls can also mean the system that has been in-place for some time not necessarily being based on outdated tech
	- giving general reccos for maintenance of legacy system is difficult because each is  unpleasant in it's own way
- we should design sw in such a way that it will minimize pain during maintenance
	- this resolution helps us avoid creating a legacy sw
- to follow the above resolution, we have three design principles for sw systems
	- operability
	- simplicity
	- evolvability
- operability
	- make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly
- simplicity
	- make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, by removing as much as complexity from the system
		- this does not mean just simplifying UI
- evolvability
	- make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future
		- adapting for unanticipated use cases as requirements change
	- aka plasticity, extensibility

## Operability : Making life easy for operations
- what is operations?
	- management and maintenance of IT infra within a business
	- involves implementation of new techs, such as sw automation to reduce manual labor
	- ensures systems are secure, reliable and compliant with industry regulations and best practices
- good operations can often work around limitations of bad(or incomplete) sw
- good sw cannot run reliably with bad operations
- operations teams are vital to keep a sw system running smoothly
- responsibilities:
	- monitoring and system restoration(from failure)
	- tracking down causes of problems
		- problems such as system failure or degraded performance
	- keeping sw and pfs up to date, including security patches
	- keeping tabs on how different systems affect each other, so that problematic changes can be avoided
	- anticipating future problems and solving them b4 they occur(ex: capacity planning)
	- establishing good practices and tools for deployment, configuration management and more
	- performing complex maintenance tasks, such as moving an app from one pf to another
	- maintaining the security of the system as configuration changes are made
	- preserving the organization's knowledge about the system, even as individuals come and go
	- defining processes that make the operations predictable and help keep the production env stable
