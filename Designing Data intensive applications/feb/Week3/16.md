- good operability means making routine tasks easy, allowing operations team to focus on imp things
- to make routines easy, data systems can do:
	- providing visibility into runtime behavior and internals of the system, with good monitoring
		- clearly printing out log files where logs are present
	- providing good support for automation and integration with standard tools
		- so that standard tasks can be handled with standard tools
	- avoiding dependency on individual machines(allows them to go through maintenance while the system continues functioning)
	- providing good documentation and an easy-to-understand operational model ('if I do X, Y will happen")
	- providing good default behavior, but also giving admins the freedom to override defaults when needed
	- self-healing where appropriate, but also giving administrators manual control over the system state when needed
	- exhibiting predictable behavior, minimizing surprises

## Simplicity: Managing Complexity
- complexity slows down everyone who needs to work on the system
	- increases cost of maintenance
- symptoms of complexity:
	- explosion of state space, tight coupling of modules, tangled dependencies, inconsistent naming and terminology etc...
- ***complexity also invites bugs*** when making a change
	- when the system is harder for developers to understand and reason about, hidden assumptions, unintended consequences etc.
- making a system simple can also mean removing ***accidental complexity***
- ***accidental complexity***: when complexity is not inherent in the problem that the sw solves (as seen by the users) but arises only from the implementation
- one of the best tools for removing accidental complexity is abstraction
	- good abstraction can hide a great deal of implementation from the user
	- a good abstraction can also be used for different apps
		- quality improvements can benefit all applications that use it
	- ex: high-level programming langs are abstractions that hide machine code, CPU registers and syscalls
		- SQL is an abstraction that hides complex on-disk and in-mem ds etc
- finding good abstractions is very hard


## Evolvability: Making Change easy
- Agile working patterns provide a fw for adapting to change
	- ***test-driven development*** and ***refactoring*** are some technical tools and patterns developed for frequently changing env
- the ease with which we can modify a data system is closely linked to its simplicity and abstractions
	- simple and easy to understand systems are usually easier to modify than complex ones


# CH 2: Data Models and Query Languages
- data models determine how the sw is written and how we think about the problem we are solving
- most applications are built by layering one data model on top of another
	- for each layer, the key question is: how is it represented in terms of the next-lower layer
- ex:
	- as an app dev, we look at the real world and model it in terms of objects or ds and APIs that manipulate those data structures
		- these structures are specific to our app
	- we express these ds in terms of general purpose data models(JSON, XML, tables in RDB etc) when we want to store them
	- the db sw engineers decide on a way of representing the (JSON/XML/RDB data) in terms of bytes in mem or disk. the representation may allow the data to be queried, searched or manipulated in various ways
	- on the lowest of levels, hw engineers have figured out a way to represent bytes in terms of electrical currents, pulses of light
- a layer hides the complexity of the layers below it
	- different layer allowing different users to work with
- every dm has it's own assumptions on how the data is going to be used
	- some operations are fast/possible but some are slow/impossible
- deciding on a dmodel is important because it determines what the sw above it can or cannot do
