## Graph Models Contd
- there are several ways of structuring and querying data in graphs
- two models are discussed for now:
	- property graph model(implemented by neo4j, titan)
	- triple-store model(implemented by Datomic, AllegroGraph)
- ***declarative query languages*** covered:
	- Cypher, SPARQL, Datalog
- ***Imperative QL*** also exist: Gremlin
- graph processing fw: Pregel
### Property Graphs
- directed graphs
- in this model:
	- each vertex consists of
		- a unique identifier
		- a set of outgoing edges
		- a set of incoming edges
		- a collection of properties(key-value pairs)
	- each edge consists of
		- a unique identifier
		- the vertex at which the edge starts(the tail vertex)
		- the vertex at which the edge ends(the head vertex)
		- a label to describe the kind of relationship bw the two vertices
		- a collection of properties(kvp)
- graph store can be ***thought of*** consisting ***two relational tables***
	- one for vertices and one for edges

- properties are stored using the json datatype above
- ***incoming and outgoing edges*** for a vertex can be found by querying on ***edges table's head and tail vertex respectively***
- important aspects of the model
	- any vertex can be connected to any other vertex by an edge, vertices are not restricted on which vertices they can be connected to
	- given any vertex, we can ***efficiently*** find both its incoming and its outgoing edges, and thus traverse the graph
		- by traverse, we can move forward and backward
		- this is why, in the above definition, the head and tail have indexes on them
	- by using different labels for different kinds of relationships, we can store several different kinds of information in a single graph, while still maintaining a clean dm
		- these labels can help in querying as well

- in the above, we can see different ***regional*** structures(US: county, state; fr: department, region) represented with ease
	- this would have been difficult to represent, if we went for RM, with columns in the same table
- also we can see different granularity of data: Lucy's birth location is represented at a state level, but her current residence is represented at a city level
- graphs are good for evolvability
	- we can easily extend graphs as we gather more data about the entities above
- above i do not see any UID

### The Cypher Query Language
- Cypher is a ***DQL*** for ***property graphs***, created for Neo4j graph db
![[Pasted image 20240223191005.png]]
- above is a cypher query to insert partial details of Lucy
- first four lines define vertices
- each vertex is given a ***symbolic name*** like USA or Idaho or NAmerica
	- these names can be used by other parts of the current query to create edges between the vertices
	- these are not labels and these names are not stored in the db
	- these are just used for querying
	- also see that each vertex is associated with a data type
- the last two lines ***create edges*** using an arrow notation (Idaho) -\[:WITHIN\]-> (USA)
	- the name WITHIN between the braces is the ***label*** of the edge
	- Idaho is the tail and USA is the head, remember these are symbolic links
- after all the data is inserted, a possible query may be:
	- all the vertices that have a BORN_IN edge to a location within the US, and also a LIVING_IN edge to a location within Europe, and return the name property of those vertices
![[Pasted image 20240223191945.png]]
- the arrow notations can be seen within the MATCH clause to find patterns in the graph
	- (person) -\[:BORN_IN\]-> () ***matches any two vertices*** that are related by the edge labeled BORN_IN
	- `person` above is a variable
		- the tail vertex of the edge, that is matched, is bound to the variable
	- the empty () mean that the head vertex is unnamed
- the query can be read as follows:
	- find any vertex(call it a `person`) that meets both of the following conditions:
		- person has an outgoing BORN_IN edge to some vertex. from that vertex we can follow a chain of(represented by \*0) outgoing WITHIN edges until we reach a vertex of type Location, whose name property is equal to "United States"
		- that same person vertex also has an outgoing LIVES_IN edge. following that edge, and then a chain of outgoing WITHIN edges, until we reach a vertex of type location whose name property is equal to "Europe"
	- notice that the symbolic names differ here
