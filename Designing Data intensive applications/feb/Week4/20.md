## Query Langs for data
- SQL is declarative
- CODASYL(NWM) queried data using imperative code
- Imperative lang tells the computer to perform certain operations in a certain order
- in declarative query lang, we specify the pattern of data we want but not how to achieve it
	- query optimizer decides the how: what indexes to use and what join methods to use, in which order to execute various parts of the query
- declarative is attractive because it is concise(more information in few words) and easier to work with
	- allows the dbs to introduce performance improvements without requiring any changes to queries
- declarative langs often lend themselves to parallel execution
	- imperative is very hard to parallelize across multiple cores and multiple machines, because it specifies instructions that must be performed in particular order
	- so DPL have a better chance of getting faster in parallel execution

### Declarative queries on the web
- DQL not only limited to DB
- CSS and XSL are declarative langs for specifying the styling of a doc
	- whereas JS is not
- for the same fnality, JS code takes more lines than the CSS version
	- concise
- DQLs can take advantage of improvements of the query engine without having to change the code
