## MapReduce Querying
- MR is a programming model for processing large amounts of data in bulk across machines
	- a limited form of MR is supported by some NoSQL datastores ex: MongoDB for performing read only queries across many docs
- MR is neither a declarative query language nor a fully imperative query API
	- somewhere in between
- the logic of the query is expressed in ***snippets*** of code, which are repeatedly called by the processing fw
- MR is based on the map and reduce fns that exist in many functional programming languages
- the following is a query that can be run on PSQL

- the above query's logic is written in MongoDb's MR feature:

1. filter is specified declaratively(this is specific to MongoDb's extension of MR)
2. the ***js function*** `map` is called for every document that matches the specified query, with `this` set to the document object
3. the map fn emits a key(string) and a value(num)
4. the key-value pairs emitted by map are grouped by ***key***. for all key-value pairs with the same key, the reduce fn is called ***once***
5. the reduce fn adds up the number of animals from all observations in a particular month
6. the final output is written to the collection monthlySharkReport

- map and reduce fns are restricted in some ways
- they must be pure fns
	- they only use the data that is passed to them as input
	- they cannot perform additional database queries
	- they must not have any side effects(state variable?)
- these restrictions allow the db to run the queries anywhere(does this mean any piece of data and/or any other machine which may not be able to access any other data), in ***any order*** and rerun them on failure
- they can parse strings, call lib fns, perform calculations and more
- higher-level query languages like SQL can be implemented as a pipeline of MR operations
	- but there are also many distributed implementations of SQL that dont use MR
	- this is possible because there is nothing in SQL that constraints it to running on a single machine
- writing JS code in middle of a query is not limited to MR
	- some SQL dbs can be extended with JS fns too
- usability problem with MR is that we have to write two carefully coordinated JS fns, which is often harder than writing a single query
	- remember auto-query optimization is not included as part of MR
- due to the above drawbacks, MongoDB added support for a declarative query language called the ***aggregation pipeline***
	- uses JSON based syntax

## Graph-like DMs
- many-to-many rls are an important distinguishing feature bw different data models
- doc model is appropriate for tree-structured(OTM) or no relationship bw records
- RM can handle simple cases of MTM
- as connections get more complex, it becomes more ***natural*** to start modeling data as graph
- graph consists of two kinds of objects:
	- ***vertices***(aka nodes or entities) and ***edges***(aka relationships or arcs)
- different types of data that can be modeled as graph:
	- social graphs
		- vertices are people and edges indicate which people know each other
	- web graphs
		- vertices are web pages and edges indicate HTML links to other pages
	- road or rail nws
		- vertices are jns, and edges represent the roads or railway lines bw them
- well known algos can operate on graphs: car navigation systems to find shortest distance bw two points
- above ex include only homogenous data(ex: people to people etc)
- graphs are not limited to homogenous data
	- ex: fb maintains a single graph with many different types of vertices and edges
		- vertices: people, locations, events, checkins, post, comments made by users
		- edges: friends, which checkin happened in which loc, who commented on which post etc
