- message queue: is a form of asynchronous service-to-service comms used in serverless or microservices arch(MSA)
	- asynchronous service-to-service comms: there is a lag bw the receiving a message to responding to one
	- MSA : large app to be separated into smaller independent parts, with each part having responsibilities of it's own
	- service means a sw fnality and its usage policies(which control its usage based on who access it)
	- Serverless arch: apps and services are built, run without having to manage infra 
- in the last decade, many developments in dbs, distributed systems and in the ways we build apps on top of them
- some driving factors for many developments
	- companies need to handle huge volumes of data and traffic
	- businesses need to be agile
		- respond quickly to market insights
		- keep dev cycle short and data models flexible
	- boom of open-source sw
	- advent of multi-core processors and network speed
- we call an app ***data-intensive*** if the primary challenge is data and data-related
	- challenges: quantity, complexity of data and the speed at which it is changing
- tools and tech that help DIA store and process data have been rapidly adapting to these challenges
- to build apps, we need accurate understanding of the various tech and their tradeoffs
- behind the rapidly changing tech, there are principles that remain true, which helps us
	- pick a tool, understand where it fits, how to make good use of it and how to avoid it's pitfalls

# CH1: Reliable, Scalable and Maintainable Apps
- DIAs are built from std building blocks that provide commonly needed fnality
- the commonly needed fnalities are:
	- store data
	- remember the result of an expensive operation
	- filter data in various ways
	- send message to another process, to be handled asynchronously
	- periodically process large amount of accumulated data
- there are several ways to do every one of the above
- when building an app, we need to find the best way possible to do the above depending on the task

## Thinking about data systems
- database and a message queue have a superficial similarity - both store data for some time
	- but they have different access patterns, which means diff performance and thus diff usages
	- access patterns: how a data storage system allows to read and write data
- data storage and processing tools differ in what they are optimized for
	- ex: Redis(datastore that are also used as message queues), Apache Kafka(message queues with db like durability guarantees)
- many apps now have wide-ranging data storage and processing requirements
	- that cannot be met with a single tool
- work is broken down to tasks that can be performed efficiently on a single tool
	- then the different tools are stitched together using app code
- for example, if we have an application managed cache using a tool which is separate from the main DB, it is the app code's responsibility to keep them in sync

- API provides abstraction of the implementation details from the client
- how do we
	- ensure data correctness and completeness, even when things go wrong internally?
	- provide consistent performance to clients, even when parts of the system are degraded?
	- how do we scale to meet increased load?
