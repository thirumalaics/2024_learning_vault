- different factors influence design of a data system
	- including skills of the people involved
- ***three*** concerns that are important in most sw sys
	- reliability
	-  [[Designing Data intensive applications/JAN/Week1/19#Scalability|Scalability]]
	- [[Designing Data intensive applications/feb/Week3/14#Maintainability|Maintainability]]
- reliability
	- the system should continue to work correctly even in the face of adversity
		- correctly: perform the correct functionality at the desired level of performance
		- adversity: hw and/or sw faults, human errors
- scalability
	- as the system grows in data volume, traffic volume, or data complexity, there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth
- maintainability
	- people working on the system, on different aspects, should be able to work on it productively
		- different aspects: maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new use cases

### Reliability
- continue to work correctly, even when things go wrong
- for sw, reliability expectations include #checked
	- expected fnality
	- tolerate user mistakes or using the sw in unexpected ways
	- prevents unauthorized access and abuse
	- performance is good enough under expected load and data volume
- components that can go wrong are called ***faults***
- systems that anticipate faults and can cope with them are ***fault-tolerant and resilient***
	- not all faults can be anticipated and be coped with
	- systems can only tolerate certain type of faults
- fault != failure
	- ***fault: a component of the system deviating from its spec***
	- failure: when the system stops providing the required service
- ***fault-tolerance*** mechanisms ***prevent failures*** by dealing with faults
	- they ***do not prevent faults***
- triggering faults deliberately can help us ***identify weak areas*** in our systems and provide us a opportunity to handle them
- generally tolerance of faults preferred over prevention
	- prevention is preferred when it comes to security
- faults that can be cured:
	- hw faults, sw and human errors

#### HW faults
- hard-disk crash, RAM faults etc
- first response is to add redundancy to the individual hw components in order to reduce the failure of the system
	- when one component dies, the redundant component can take its place while the broken one is replaced
		- cannot completely prevent hw probs from causing failures
		- but can keep a machine running
		- makes total failure of a single machine fairly rare
	- if we are able to restore a backup onto a new machine quickly, the downtime is not a big deal
	- until recently, redundancy was sufficient
- there is an increase in the number of machines being used, due to increase in data volumes and computing demands
	- this increases the rate of hw faults
	- cloud prioritizes flexibility and elasticity over single-machine reliability
- as a soln, sw fault tolerance tech are preferred ***in addition to*** hw redundancy
	- goal is to have systems that can tolerate the loss of entire machines
	- this loss might be due to downtime for updates as well
		- if sw fault tolerance tech is used, we can update one node at a time, without downtime of the entire system(rolling update) and the system is able to cope
