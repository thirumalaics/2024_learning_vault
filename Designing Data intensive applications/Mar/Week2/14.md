- What is vectorized processing?


### Sort order in Column Storage
- in column store, it does not matter in which order the rows are stored
	- easier to store them in the order they were inserted
		- then inserting will become append
- we can choose to impose order 
- sorting each col separately does not make sense for obvious reasons
- the data needs to be sorted an entire row at a time
	- helps in performance of common queries if sorted correctly
	- sorting can even help in grouping 
- sorting can help with compression of columns
	- if primary sort col does not have many distinct value, after sorting it might make sense to apply ***run-length encoding***
