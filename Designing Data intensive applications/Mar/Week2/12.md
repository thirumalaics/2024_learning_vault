#### Keeping everything in mem contd
- in-mem dbs could be extended to support larger ds than available mem
	- without bringing back the overhead of a disk-centric arch
	- anti-caching approach
		- designed for supporting ***datasets larger than available mem***
		- ***evicts lru data*** from mem to disk when there is not enough mem
		- loaded back into mem when required
		- similar to what OS does
		- db can manage memory more ***efficiently*** than the OS
			- it can work at a granularity of individual records rather than entire mem pages
		- this approach requires indexes to fit entirely in mem
- non-volatile memory tech is under research

## Txn processing or Analytics
- earlier business data processing involved a write to the db when a ***commercial txn*** took place
	- making a sale, placing an order etc...
- dbs expanded to other domains but the word txn stuck
	- txn now referred to as ***group of reads and writes that form a logical unit***
- txn processing ***need not*** necessarily have ACID properties
	- ***txn processing*** just means allowing ***low-latency reads and writes***
	- different to batch ***processing jobs***, which runs periodically
- even though dbs were used for many different kinds of depts, ***basic access pattern*** remained similar to processing business txn:
	- an app ***looks up a small number of records*** by some key, using an index
	- records are ***inserted or updated*** based on the user's input
	- because these apps are ***interactive***, the access pattern was known as OLTP
- dbs also started being used for ***data analytics***
	- ***different access pattern***
		- scan over a huge number of records, reading a few cols per record, calculate agg statistics
			- does not return the ***raw data*** like the OLTP
	- the queries are written by business analysts
	- data feeds the reports which help the company make better decisions(BI)
	- to differentiate this usage pattern: OLAP
	- the difference bw OLAP and OLTP is not always clear cut
	- the use of online in OLAP is unclear
		- probably refers to the fact that queries are not just for pre-defined reports
		- analysts use the OLAP system interactively for explorative queries
![[Pasted image 20240312095329.png]]
- at first, the ***same db*** were used for both txn processing and analytic queries
	- SQL turned out to be flexible for both
	- later companies stopped using OLTP systems for analytics
	- analytics on a separate db instead
	- this separate db is called dwh

### DWHing
- an enterprise may have ***dozens of different txn processing systems***
	- each of these systems may end up operating mostly ***autonomously***
- OLTP systems are expected to be ***highly available***
	- because they are critical to the operation of business
	- dbas ***closely guard*** their OLTP dbs
	- ad hoc BA queries can ***take up resources*** which can harm txns that need to run
- DWH - ***separate db without affecting OLTP operations***
	- contains a ***read only copy of data*** from all the various OLTP sys
- data is ***extracted*** from the OLTPS
	- using periodic data dump or a continuous stream of updates
- data is ***transformed*** into analysis friendly schema, cleaned up, then ***loaded*** into the dwh
	- this process of getting data into wh is known as ETL
![[Pasted image 20240312100431.png]]
- dwh exist in all large enterprises
	- almost unheard of in smaller companies
		- because they might not have many OLTPSs and they might have small amounts of data
		- in this case, data can be queried in the same conventional SQL db or analyzed in a spreadsheet
- separation of OLTPS from OLAPS, so that OLAP ***optimized for analytic access patterns***
	- indexes discussed in this chapter not very good for analytic queries
	- because we are not going to pick out one or two rows from the dataset

#### the divergence bw OLTP dbs and dwhs
- dm of a dwh is commonly relational
	- because SQL is a good fit for analytic queries
- graphical data analysis tools exist
	- generate SQL queries, visualize results and allow analysts to explore data
		- through operations such as ***drill-down*** and ***slicing and dicing***
		- drill down - add more cols to group by to see much more granular data
		- slicing and dicing - multi dimensional analysis, a method used to analyze data from various angles or dimensions
			- involves breaking down a large dataset into smaller subsets, or slices based on specific criteria and then examining each slices to gain insights
- main difference is ***query patterns***
- there is support for both in some dbs
- but commonly two separate storage and query engines are used
	- which happen to be accessible through a ***common SQL interface***
