## Sort Order in Column Storage contd
- the effect of sorting and compression is ***strongest*** in the first sorting column
- columns further down in the sorting order ***appear in random***
	- hence compression is not strong

#### Several different sort orders
- anyways we will have to replicate the data in different machines
	- why not store them ***sorted by different columns and orders***
	- so that different queries can benefit from different sort order data
- having multiple sort orders in a COS is a bit similar to having ***multiple secondary indexes*** in ROS
	- diff: ROS keeps ***every row in one place***: heap file or clustered index
		- secondary indexes just contain pointers to matching rows
	- in COS there are ***no pointers*****
**
### Writing to COS
- COS, compression, sorting - all help to make read queries faster
- downside is ***difficult write***
- an ***update in place approach is not possible*** with compressed columns
	- because sort order is in place
	- the update might affect the order
- insertion becomes difficult, especially one that requires row to be inserted in middle
	- all ***column files should be re-written***
- a good soln to this problem can be similar to ***LSMT***(Log structured merge-tree)
	- writes go to a ***in-mem store***, where they are added to a ***sorted structure***
	- it does not matter if in-mem store is RO or CO
	- when enough writes have accumulated, they are ***merged*** with the column files on disk
	- queries need to ***examine both*** disk and in-mem buffer

### Aggregation: Data Cubes and materialized views
- not every dwh uses COS
	- traditional RO dbs and few other archs are used
	- columnar storage ***can be significantly faster*** for ad hoc analytical queries
- ***materialized aggregates***
	- caching some of the counts and sums that queries use most often
	- one way of creating such cache is ***materialized view***
	- a normal view is a shortcut for writing queries
	- ***materialized view***:
		- ***copy of query results written to disk***
		- when the underlying data changes, a materialized view ***needs to be updated***
		- db can do that automatically
		- this makes sense for DWH because data is denormalized
		- ***the effect on read performance depends on the individual case***
	- a common special case of materialized view is known as ***data cube*** or ***OLAP cube***
		- grid of aggregates grouped by different dimensions
		- the following figure has two dimensions(product and date)
		- each cell contains aggregate(SUM) of an attribute(net_price)
		- the same aggregate can be applied ***along each row or column***
			- to get summary for one dimension(the sales by product regardless of data or vice versa)
		- in general there will be many dims
		- ***each cell*** will contain an agg for ***combination of all the dims***
		- these values can be ***summarized along each dimension***
		- certain queries are sped up because the results are ***precomputed***
		- OLAPC are used as ***performance boosters*** for certain queries
		- they are not flexible for all queries
