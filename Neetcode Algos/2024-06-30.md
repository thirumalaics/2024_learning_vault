- data structure
	- structuring data inside RAM
	- RAM is where all our variables are going to be stored
	- every value is going to be stored in an address
	- when we store array in RAM, it is going to be contiguous
		- depending on which element of array we are reading, the specific addressed is looked for
	- python offers dynamic array as a default
## static arrays
- reading an element, overwriting an element, writing an element in a array are all O(1)
- inserting in any pos other than the end will be worst case O(n)

## Dynamic arrays
- in many langs, dynamic arrays start with some default size
- when this array does not have space to hold any more values, a new array is created with a bigger size newly in memory
	- the contents of the original array are now copied into this bigger array
	- at this point, the previous array is deallocated from memory
	- usually the new array created will be double in size even if we just want to add one element
		- why? because this operation is O(n)(creating) + O(n) (copying contents) even if we just want one element to be added
		- amortized complexity
