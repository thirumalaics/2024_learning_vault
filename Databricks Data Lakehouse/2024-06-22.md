## Unified governance and security structure
- objectives
	- explain how important unified governance and security is to pf architecture
		- data breaches chances increase as the number of accesses given increases
		- at the same time, it is important to provide access to data team and members
		- challenges to data and AI governance
			- diversity of data and AI assets
				- not limited to just file and tables
				- can include dashboards, videos, MLModels
			- using two disparate and incompatible data pf
				- past needs forced businesses to use DWHs for BI and DLs for AI
				- leads to data duplications and unsynchronized governance models
			- rise of multi-cloud adoption
				- where each cloud has it's own governance model and requires individual familiarity
			- fragmented tool usage for data governance
				- introduces complexity and multiple integration points in the system leading to poor performance
		- to address the above challenges, db offers the following solns:
			- unity catalog
				- unified governance soln for all data assets
			- delta sharing
				- open soln to securely share live data to any competing pf
			- two planes(control and data plane) - divided arch to two planes
				- to simplify permission, avoid data duplication and reduce risks
## Unity Catalog
- unified governance soln for all data assets
- modern lhs support fine grained row, column and view level access ctrl via SQL, query auditing, attr based access ctrl, data versioning and data quality constraints and monitoring
- dba should be familiar with std i/fs allowing existing personnel to manage all data in a uniform way
- provides common governance model based on ANSI SQL to define and enforce fine grained access ctrl on all data and AI assets on any cloud
	- provides one consistent model to discover, access and share data 
		- enabling better native performance, management and security across clouds
