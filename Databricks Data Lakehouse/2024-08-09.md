## Divided security architecture
- control plane and the data plane
- what are contents of the control plane?
	- managed backend services that db provides
	- these live in db cloud account 
		- aligned with whatever cloud service the client is using: AWS, Azure or GCP
	- ![[Pasted image 20240809154023.png]]
	- web application, configurations, logs, user info, notebooks, repos, DBSQL, cluster manager and clusters(serverless)
		- information in the control plane are encrypted at rest and communication to and from the control plane is encrypted in transit
- what are the contents of the data plane?
	- where the data is processed
	- unless we use serverless compute, compute resources in the data plane run inside the business owner's own cloud account
	- all the data stays where it is
- 
- security of the data plane within our chosen cloud service provider is important


- db supports many was to enable users to access their data
- the table acls feature uses traditional sql based statements to manage access to data and enable fine-grained view-based access
