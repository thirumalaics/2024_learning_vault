## Unity Catalog Contd

- ***single source of truth*** for all user identities and data assets in the dblhpf
- ***common md layer*** for diff workspace md is at the account level
	- ***single access point with common interface*** for collaboration from any workspace in the pf
- UC allows us to ***restrict access to certain rows and columns*** to the users and groups 
- with attr based access ctrl, we can simplify governance at scale by ***controlling access to multiple data items at one time***
	- ex: pii in multiple cols can be tagged and access can be restricted to the cols with those tags
- ***data access audits*** are necessary to understand whether regulatory compliances are met
	- UC provides highly detailed audit trail logging who has performed what against the data
- to break down data silos and make all data available for data driven decisions there is ***a UI for data search and discovery***
	- as part of UC
- low latency md serving and auto tuning of tables enables UC to provide 38 times faster performance than hive ms  
- data lineage encompasses all transformations and refinements from source to insights
- what details does the data lineage consists?
	- where it came from
	- other datasets it might have been combined with
	- who created it and when
	- what transformations were performed 
	- other events and attrs
- table to column level ***automated data lineage charts*** provided by UC
- UC integrates with existing tools

## Delta Sharing
- existing data sharing techs come with several limitations
- traditional data sharing tech does not scale well(sftp)
- cloud object store operate on a object level and are cloud specific
- vendor solns often share tables instead of files
	- scaling is expensive
	- not open, no data sharing to a diff pf

- delta sharing - open source soln to share live data from our lh to any computing pf securely
	- recipients do not have to be in the same cloud or even use the dblhpf
	- data is not simply replicated or moved
	- additionally data providers still maintain management and governance of data with the ability to track and audit usage
#### Benefits of delta sharing
- open cross-pf sharing
	- easily allowing sharing of existing data in delta lake in apache parquet format
	- no need to establish new ingestion processes to consume data
	- provides native integration with powerBI, tableau, spark, pandas and Java 
- share live data without copying it
	- with data being maintained in the provider's data lake
	- ensuring that the datasets are reliable in real time and provide the most current data to the recipient
- centralized administration and governance to the data provider
	- data governed, tracked and audited from a single location
	- allows usage to be monitored at the table, partition and version level
- marketplace for data products
	- build and package data products through a central market place for distribution to anywhere
- privacy-safe data clean rooms
	- collab bw data providers and recipients is hosted in a secure env while safeguarding data privacy
- UC natively supports delta sharing
- delta sharing is a simple rest protocol that securely shares access to part of a cloud dataset
	- leveraging modern cloud storage systems, it can reliably transfer large datasets
