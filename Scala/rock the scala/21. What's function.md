- fnal programming is to use and work with functions as first class elements
	- work with them as if they are just another value
- scala supports Function types
	- just like it supports int, String etc...
	- there many function types: Function1, Function2 etc.. up to 22
		- 22 here signifies number of parameters
	- for a function with one parameter and one result: `Function1[A,B]`

```
val stringToIntConverter = new Function1[String, Int] {
	override def apply(string: String): Int = string.toInt
}
println(stringToIntConverter("3") + 4)
val adder = new Function2[Int, Int, Int] {
	override def apply(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a+b
}
```
- when we inspect the type of adder: `((Int, Int) => Int)` // syntactic sugar for Function2 type
```
val stringToIntConverter: String => Int = new Function1[String, Int] {
	override def apply(string: String): Int = string.toInt
}
val adder: (Int,Int) => Int = new Function2[Int, Int, Int] {
	override def apply(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a+b
}
```
- all scala functions are objects of classes deriving from function1,....
- this can used def instead of val for function definitions like below:
```
def concatenator: (String, String) => String =  new Function1[String, String, String] {
override def apply(a: String, b: String) : String = s"${a} ${b}"
}
```

- functions that either receive functions as arguments or return functions  are called HOF
- the returned function from a function that returns a function will have access to args, vars from the parent function
```
val superAdder = new Function1[Int, Function1[Int, Int]] {  
  def apply(a: Int) : Function1[Int, Int]= new Function[Int, Int]{
	  def apply(b: Int) = a+b
  }
}

val addd = superAdder(3)(21) // x is 3 and it is accessible by the function retruned by superAdder
```

- super adder function is called a curried function
	- curried functions have the property that they can be called with multiple parameter lists
	- they can be said to receive some parameter and they return a function that receives some other parameter

## Anonymous Functions
- till now instantiating an object of type function remains very much like instantiating an object of any other class
	- the point is it is very object oriented

```
val doubler = (x: Int) => x*2
val doubler2: Int => Int = x => x*2 
val adder = (a: Int, b: Int) => a+b
val adder1: (Int, Int) => Int = (a, b) => a+b // in this case compiler is intelligent to infer
```
- the above is called an anonymous function or a lambda
- if we want to define an anonymous function that takes no args:

```
val justDoSomething = () => 2
```
- the type of the above variable:
	- () => Int
- lambda functions must be called with parenthesis in order to execute them
	- else the instance is just printed
```
val myFunc: Int => Int = {(x: Int) => {  
  if x == 1 then 1 + 100000  
  else 20000  
}  
}
```
- still the above definition is an anonymous function
- more syntactic sugar
	- `val niceIncrementer: Int => Int = _ + 1`
		- this is equivalent to `val niceIncrementer: Int => Int = x => x+1`
	- `val niceAdder: (Int, Int) => Int = _ + _`
		- this is equivalent to `val niceAdder: (Int, Int) => Int = (a,b) => a+b `
		- each underscore stands for a different parameter
- to use the above syntactic sugar, we must specify types like above
- we cannot use an underscore multiple times to represent the same arg
	- each time an underscore is used, it is used to represent a different arg
