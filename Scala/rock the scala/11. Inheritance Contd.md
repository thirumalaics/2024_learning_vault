- instance variables can be overridden in the constructor as well
- instance variable in the child class cannot have the same name as an instance variable in parent class
	- if this is needed, we have to override otherwise error
	- ![[Pasted image 20240914164834.png]]
	- even tried with var, it did not work
```
class Animal(val name: String, creatureType: String){  
  val creature: String = "Wild"  
  var c = 1  
  def sound: String = "growl"  
}  
  
class Dog(override val name: String, creatureType: String) extends Animal(name, creatureType){  
  override val creature: String = "1"  
  c = 12  
}
```
- as depicted above, we do not have to override creatureType variable as it is just the constructor parameter

```
class Animal {
	val creatureType: String = "Wild"
}
class Dog(override val creatureType: String) extends Animal {  // instance variable of the parent class is overridden in the constructor itself
  override def eat = println("Woof woof")  
}
  
val dog = new Dog("K9")

// the above class can also be written as:
class Dog(dogType: String) extends Animal { // here we do not pass any args to Animal constructor
	override val creatureType = dogType
	override def eat = println("Woof woof")
}
```

- while overriding methods, the method in child class should have the same signature as the parent method
	- same number of parameters, same types in the same order
- all instances of the derived classes will use the overridden members when possible
- we can also perform a type substitution
	- where we can use a Dog in place of an Animal
		- child class in place of the parent class
```
val d: Animal = new Dog("k9") //polymorphism, even though type is animal this instance can accesses overriden members
d.eat // dog class's overridden version of eat is called
// but important thing to note is members exclusive to Dog are not availble from the variable d
```
- the call from the child class will go to the most overridden member
- because d variable is of type Animal, it can only access members of the class animal
	- when accessing members of the class animal, it accesses the most overridden version
	- we cannot access any member method or variable of Dog class even though we are creating the object using the Dog class
	- this kind of works like implicit conversion
```
class Animal{
	val creatureType = "Wild"
	def eat(hi: String) = println(s"${hi}")
}

class Dog extends Animal{
	super.eat("Hi") // works without any issue
	override val creatureType = "Domestic"
	def eat = { // overloading
		super.eat("asda")
		println("I do not eat")
	}
	def ching(): Unit = println("Ching")
}

val d: Animal = new Dog
println(d.creatureType)
d.eat // this errors out as we are trying to call the Dog class exclusive overloaded method
d.ching() // also errors out because this method is only present in Dog class
```


- overriding
	- supplying different implementations in ***derived class*** but with the same signature
	- one of the methods is in the parent class and the other in the child class
	- polymorphism applies to overriding
	- run-time concept
	- real object type in the runtime, not the reference variable's type, determines which overridden method is used at run time
		- in the above example, real object type of d is of Dog, so the overridden method from dog class is called
- overloading
	- method with the same name is defined with different signatures in the same class
		- this seems to be the std definition
		- so the eat method without any arg in the Dog method is not overloaded? 
			- one SO ans says it is an [overload](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15291400/is-this-overloading-methods-with-same-name-in-different-classes-and-different-s)
	- compile time concept
	- reference type determines which overloaded method will be used at compile time
		- in the above example reference type of d is Animal, so the overloaded eat method with an argument is only callable but not the eat with no argument
- super
	- keyword used to access member (he mentioned both method/field) of the parent class from the child class
		- but for some reason I am not able to access a super field
		- I can easily access parent class's protected and public field directly from my child class without any super keyword when I have not overridden in child class
		- when I have [overridden](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39309321/overriding-vals-in-scala), I cannot use super keyword to access the parent class's variables
	- `super.methodname`
	- this can be used within the class definition or method definition
- preventing overrides
	- limiting what can be overridden
		- final keyword
			- `final def eat = println("Nom nom")` // prevents child classes from overriding this method
			- final can be used on the class itself
				- `final class Animal`
				- this prevents the class itself from being extended
		- seal the class
			- we cannot extend the class in any other file than the current file
			- `sealed class Animal{}`
			- to prevent others from defining types based on what we have written
- abstract members
	- when some fields or methods are left unimplemented
	- classes that can contain abstract or unimplemented fields or methods are called abstract classes
	- there is another entity in scala which allows unimplemented members: traits
		- but historically  there have been two situations where it's better to use an abstract class than a trait:
			- we want to create a base class that takes constructor arguments
				- prior to scala 3
				- from scala 3 onwards traits can have parameters
			- the code will be called from java code
	- they are defined by the keyword `abstract`
		- `abstract class Animal`
	- abstract classes cannot be instantiated
	- only one class can be extended, irrespective of whether the class we are extending is abstract or not
	- override keyword not necessary when extending and defining from an abstract class
```
abstract class Animal {
	val creatureType: String
	def eat: Unit
}

class Dog extends Animal {
	override val creatureType = "Domestic" // I do not have to provide type hint here, as long as string it should be fine
	override def eat: Unit = println("Thenti")
}
```
