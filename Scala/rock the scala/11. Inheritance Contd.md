- instance variables can be overridden in the constructor as well
- instance variable in the child class cannot have the same name as an instance variable in parent class
	- if this is needed, we have to override otherwise error
	- ![[Pasted image 20240914164834.png]]
	- even tried with var, it did not work
```
class Animal(val name: String, creatureType: String){  
  val creature: String = "Wild"  
  var c = 1  
  def sound: String = "growl"  
}  
  
class Dog(override val name: String, creatureType: String) extends Animal(name, creatureType){  
  override val creature: String = "1"  
  c = 12  
}
```
- as depicted above, we do not have to override creatureType variable as it is just the constructor parameter

- the above code is equivalent to the following
```
class Animal {
	val creatureType: String = "Wild"
}
class Dog(override val creatureType: String) extends Animal {  
  override def eat = println("Woof woof")  
}
  
val dog = new Dog("K9")

// the above class can also be written as:
class Dog(dogType: String) extends Animal { // here we do not pass any args to Animal constructor
override val creatureType = dogType
override def eat = println("Woof woof")
}
```

- while overriding methods, the method in child class should have the same signature as the parent method
	- same number of parameters, same types in the same order
- all instances of the derived classes will use the overridden members when possible
- we can also perform a type substitution
```
val d: Animal = new Dog("k9") //polymorphism, even though type is animal this instance can accesses overriden members
d.eat // dog class's overridden version of eat is called
// but important thing to note is methods and members exclusive to Dog are not availble from the variable d
```
- the call from the child class will go to the most overridden member
- because d variable is of type Animal, it can only access members of the class animal
	- when accessing members of the class animal, it accesses the most overridden version
	- we cannot access any member method or variable of Dog class even though we are creating the object using the Dog class
	- this kind of works like implicit conversion
```
class Animal{
	val creatureType = "Wild"
	def eat(hi: String) = println(s"${hi}")
}

class Dog extends Animal{
	super.eat("Hi") // works without any issue
	override val creatureType = "Domestic"
	def eat = {
		super.eat("asda")
		println("I do not eat")
	}
	def ching(): Unit = println("Ching")
}

val d: Animal = new Dog
println(d.creatureType)
d.eat // this would 
d.ching() // also errors out because this method is only present in Dog class
```


- overriding
	- supplying different implementations in derived class but with the same signature
- overloading
	- method with the same name is defined with different signatures in the same class
- super
	- keyword used to access member(he mentioned both method/field) from the parent class
		- but for some reason I am not able to access a super field
	- `super.methodname`
	- this can be used within the class definition or method definition
- preventing overrides
	- limiting what can be overridden
		- final keyword
			- `final def eat = println("Nom nom")` // prevents child classes from overriding this method
			- final can be used on the class itself
				- `final class Animal`
				- this prevents the class itself from being extended
		- seal the class
			- we cannot extend the class in any other file than the current file
			- `sealed class Animal{}`
			- to prevent others from defining types based on what we have written
- abstract members
	- when fields or methods are left unimplemented
	- classes that contain abstract or unimplemented fields or methods are called abstract classes
	- they are defined by the keyword `abstract`
		- `abstract class Animal`
	- abstract classes cannot be instantiated
	- override keyword not necessary when extending and defining from an abstract class
```
abstract class Animal {
	val creatureType: String
	def eat: Unit
}

class Dog extends Animal {
	override val creatureType = "Domestic" // I do not have to provide type hint here, as long as string it should be fine
	override def eat: Unit = println("Thenti")
}
