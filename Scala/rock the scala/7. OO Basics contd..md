- constructor overloading
```
def this(name: String) = this(name, 0) // calls the primary constructor is also named this

class
```
- auxiliary constructors can only call other constructors
	- so in a way these new constructors are used only as a substitute for default argument
	- so it is better to use default arguments in the actual class definition
		- default parameters works for constructors as well
- object equality comparison of two separate instances result in false
	- even if the values of different attributes of the objects are equal
- check the counter class in intellij
	- a new instance is returned when we ask to modify and in a way we are implementing immutability at the object level
