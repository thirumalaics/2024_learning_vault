- constructor overloading
```
def this(name: String) = this(name, 0) // calls the primary constructor is also named this

class
```
- auxiliary constructors can only call other constructors
	- so in a way these new constructors are used only as a substitute for default argument
	- so it is better to use default arguments in the actual class definition
		- default parameters works for constructors as well
