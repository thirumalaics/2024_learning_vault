- classes can have other fields that are not part of the constructors
- the body of the class is evaluated only when it's constructor is called
```
class Person1(var firstName: String, var lastName: String):  
  
  println("initialization begins")  
  val fullName = firstName + " " + lastName  
  
  // a class method  
  def printFullName: Unit =  
    // access the `fullName` field, which is created above  
    println(fullName)  
  
  println("initialization ends")  
  printFullName  
end Person1
```

- the two print statements in the top level of the class body do not get executed until the following statement is executed: `val m = new Person1("TT", "HH")` 
	- the output is as follows:
		- initialization begins
		- initialization ends
		- TT HH
- [what is the difference between class parameter and field?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13549574/scala-what-is-the-real-difference-between-fields-in-a-class-and-parameters-in-t#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20the%20two,they%20automatically%20become%20public%20members.)
	- when class parameters are defined with var/val they become public class fields automatically
	- if we have no var/val in the class constructor signature, and dont use the variables anywhere but in the constructor, they will not become members
		- but if we do use the variables elsewhere within the class, they become private members
		- if we make them case classes, we would in the first case have no unapply for the variables
```
// first case
class Person2 {  
  var name : String = _ // filled with nulls 
  var surname: String = _  // ""
}
```
- I tried writing an explicit constructor, by explicit constructor I mean I wrote a class which did not take any arguments at it's definition but wrote a separate this method that takes the necessary args
	- this was inferred as an auxiliary constructor and not as the base constructor
	- also it mandated me to call the base constructor which is the one with no argument
```
class Person1:  
  def this(var firstName: String, var lastName:String) = {// this itself threw an error saying that var is only expected in class parameter
    this()  
    var fName = firstName;  
    var lName = lastName  
  }
end Person1
```
- constructor overloading
```
def this(name: String) = this(name, 0) // calls the primary constructor is also named this

class
```
- auxiliary constructors can only call other constructors
	- so in a way these new constructors are used only as a substitute for default argument
	- so it is better to use default arguments in the actual class definition
		- default parameters works for constructors as well
```
class Student(name: String, govtId: String)
	private var _applicationDate: Option[LocalDate] = None
	private var _studentId: Int= 0
	def this(name: String, govtId: String, appDate: LocalDate) = 
		this(name, govtId)
		_applicationDate = Some(appDate)
	
	def this(name: String, govtId: String, studentId: Int) = 
		this(name, govtId)
		_studentId = studentId
```
- object equality comparison of two separate instances of the same class results in false
	- even if the values of different attributes of the objects are equal
- check the counter class in intellij
	- a new instance is returned when we ask to modify and in a way we are implementing immutability at the object level
	- i felt like this recursive solution is unnecessary complication
