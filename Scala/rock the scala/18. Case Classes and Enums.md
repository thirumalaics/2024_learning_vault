- for light weight data structures we need to re-implement all sorts of boiler plate code like companion objections, std methods for serializing, equals, hashCode, toString etc..
	- case classes are an ideal solution to this problem
- case classes are shorthand for defining a class, companion objects and sensible defaults in one go
```
case class Person(name:String, age: Int)
val jim = new Person("Jim", 32)
println(jim.name)
println(jim.toString()) \\ this is equivalent to println(jim)
val jim2 = new Person("Jim", 32)
println(jim == jim2)
val jim3 = jim.copy()
val jim4 = jim.copy(age = 34)
val myPerson = Person // the companion object is assigned
val mary = myPerson.apply("Mary", 22)
```
- the above definition does a lot for us:
	- all class parameters are promoted to fields
		- in the above snippet, we could not have accessed name using the dot notation if not for case keyword which promotes name and age to be fields
	- sensible to string method implementation
		- without case keyword, in normal class objects the toString method returns a cryptic output
		- in general println(instance) == println(instance.toString)
	- equals and hashCode implemented out of the box
		- which makes case class useful in case of collections
		- equals operator in the case of normal class objects returns false even if all fields match
	- case classes have handy copy methods
		- comes with a copy method that returns a new instance(with same field values)
		- copy method allows arguments which are fields in the case class, this allows to make a copy and overwrite values
	- cc have companion objects
		- the companion object comes with the apply method which returns a new Person object by instantiating the class
			- obviously we must pass in parameters as needed
		- `val p = Person("T",1)` no need of new keyword
	- CCs are serializable
		-  useful when dealing with distributed systems
			- we can send the case classes across nw
	- CCs have extractor patterns
		- CCs can be used in Pattern Matching
- there is also a case object, which acts like a case class but it actually is an object 

```
case object UnitedKingdom{
def name:String = "The royal kingdom"
}
```
- case objects have the same property as case classes except they do not get companion objects as they themselves are objects
- adding case keyword to the mylist, empty and cons objects/classes makes it powerful
	- now two lists can be checked for equality

# Enums
- only from scala 3
- enums are datatypes which can be defined much like a class
	- enums will only have a bunch of instances that we create in the enum body
- to create the only possible instances of the type Permissions is to use case keyword
```
enum Permission{
 case READ, WRITE, EXECUTE, NONE
def openDocument(): Unit = 
	if this == READ then println("opening docu")
	else println("not allowed")
}
val somePermissions: Permissions.READ
somePermissions.openDocuments() // opening docu is the output
println(somePermissions.ordinal) // returns 0
println(somePermissions)
enum PermissionsWithBits(bits: Int){
	case READ extends PermissionsWithBits(4)
	case WRITE extends PermissionsWithBits(2)
	case EXECUTE extends PermissionsWithBits(1)
	case NONE extends PermissionsWithBits(0)
}
object PermissionsWithBits{
	def fromBits(bits: Int) : PermissionsWithBits = {
	PermissionsWithBits.None
	}
}
```
- using enum we can enumerate all the possible cases/instances of that type
	- and by this we have already created a sealed data type that cannot be extended
	- only possible instances are READ, WRITE, EXECUTE, NODE
- because enum helps create data types, we can add fields or methods to the enum body
- enums can also take in constructor arguments
- we can also have companion objects for enums
	- as a source for factory methods which return one possible instance of the enum
	- apply method can be added to enable `Permissions(2)`
- the string repr of the enum type will be it's name
	- for example, printing somePermissions above returns value READ
- enums comes packaged with some capabilities
	- to check the index at which the instance appears in enum
		- ex: for PermissionsWithBits, READ's index will be 0 as it is defined first
	- ability to return all possible values of an enum
		- `val permissions=Permissions.values` // returns an array of all possible values
	- create an instance of enum(which have no constructor args) from a string
		- val readPermissions = Permissions.valueOf("READ")
		- the value passed is parsed and the respective instance is returned
		- passing in a invalid value returns a run time error
		- case also matters, ex: Read wont work
