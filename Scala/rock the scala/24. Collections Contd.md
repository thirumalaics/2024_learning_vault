```
val newList = for {
n <- l1
c <- l2
color <- l3
} yield "" + c + n + "-" + color
```
- the above expression does not have side effects, but this does not mean for comprehension can be used only with non-side effects expression
```
for {
d <- l1
} println(d)
```
- the above is equivalent and identical to l1.foreach(println)
	- bts, compiler translates the for comprehension to a for each functional call
		- to a for each instead of map because, for each is for Unit return types
- another syntax for map:
```
list.map {
	x => x * 2
}
```
- the space bw map and curly brace is not important
	- it is given for readability
- MyList that we created in this course also allows for comprehension
	- because map, flat map functions are implemented by us
```
var counter = 0  
for {  
  x <- tinder  
} counter = counter + x
```
- conditions to be met in order to evaluate for comprehension on our collections:
	- the method signatures must be as follows:
		- `def map[B](fn: A => B): MyList[B]`
		- `def flatMap[B](fn: A => MyList[B]): MyList[B]`
		- `def filter(fn: A => Boolean): MyList[A]`
- Maybe is used in functional programming to denote possible absence of a value
- scala offers both mutable and immutable collections
	- scala std lib has type definitions and aliases for immutable collections
	- by default we are using immutable collections
		- when we use `List` we are literally using `immutable.List[A]`
			- List is just an alias for `immutable.List[A]
	- immutable collections are found in scala.collections.immutable package
	- immutable collection hierarchy starts from Traversable class
		- which is the mother trait of all collections
		- offers variety of methods:
			- map, flatMap, collect
			- conversions: toArray, toList, toSeq
			- size info: isEmpty, size, nonEmpty
			- tests: exists, forall
			- folds: foldLeft, foldRight, reduceLeft, reduceRight
			- retrieval: head, find, tail
			- string ops: mkString
	- traversable is extended by Iterable
		- iterable is extended by Map,  Seq, Set
	- Set is extended by HashSet and SortedSet
	- Map extended by HashMap, SortedMap
	- Seq - collections which can be traversed in a set order
		- extended by IndexedSeq and LinearSeq
	- IndexedSeq extended by Vector, String, Range
		- elements can be accessed in linear time
	- LinearSeq
		- only guarantee in some form the ordering of elements
		- extended by List, Stream, Stack, Queue
- scala.collections.mutable package hosts all the mutable collections
	- hierarchy mirrors immutable hierarchy closely: Traversable, Iterable, Set, Map, Seq
	- after this level in hierarchy implementations start to differ
	- for Sets: HashSet, LinkedHashSet
	- for Map: HashMap, MultiMap
	- for Seq: IndexedSeq, Buffer, LinearSeq
	- for IndexedSeq: StringBuilder, ArrayBuffer
	- for Buffer: ArrayBuffer, ListBuffer
	- for LinearSeq: MutableList, LinkedList
