- similar to switch/case when but much more powerful

```
val random = new Random
val x = random.nextInt(10) // exclusive of 10
val description = x match {
case 1 => "THE ONE"
case 2 => "double or nothing"
case 3 => "third time is the charm"
case _ => "the default"
}
println(description)
```
- \\_ is a wildcard
- the expression assigned to description is called called a pattern matching expression
	- each pattern is written in a case statement
	- `case patter => result`
- property of pattern matching: decompose values
	- especially when used in conjunction with case classes
	- case classes have the ability to be deconstructed or extracted in pattern matching
```
case class Person(name: String, ag: Int)
val bob = Person("Bob", 12)
val greeting = bob match {
	case Person(n, a) => s"Hi my name is $n and I am $a years old"
	case _=> "I dont know who I am" // not mandatory to define a default case
}
```
- if bob is a person, the pattern match expression is able to deconstruct Bob into it's constituent parts: name and age, even though the pattern match expression does not know them before hand
	- bob should atleast be a subclass of Person, otherwise the above snippet will error out
```
var boby = ""  
println( boby match {  
  case Person(n, a) => s"Hi my name is $n and I am $a years old" 
  case _ => "I dont know who I am"  
})
```
- trying something like above errors out
```
val greeting = bob match {
	case Person(n, a) if a < 13 => s"Hi my name is $n and I am a minor"
	case Person(n,a) => s"Hi my name is $n and I am $a years old"
	case _ => "I dont know who i am"
}
```
- if a < 13 is called a gaurd
- cases are matched in order and value of the pattern which matches first will be returned
- when no case is matched and there is no default like in the below, an MatchError is thrown
```
var greetingImp = bob match {  
  case Person(n, a) if a < 13 => s"My name is $n and I am a minor"
  }
```
- what is the type of the pattern match expression
	- it is the unification of all the expressions returned by all the cases
	- the type for the first snippet in this file is a string as the results are strings
```
val description1: Any = x match {  
  case 1 => "THE ONE"  
  case 2 => 12  
  case 3 => "third time is the charm"  
  case _ => 13  
}
```

- inferred type is Any for the above expression
