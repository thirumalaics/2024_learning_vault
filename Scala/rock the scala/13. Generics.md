- powerful tool in scala type system
- in the inheritance exercise, we created a harcoded(in terms of type) collection, so now if we want a string collection we need to copy paste the code and change the int to string
- generics helps us generalize our code
	- to be specific, we can create a collections class which can be used to create collections of any type
- trait can also be type parameterized
- objects cannot be parameterized
```
class MyList[A]{ // this is called a generic a class
    // use the type A
    
}
val listOfInt = new MyList[Int]
val listOfStr = new MyList[String]
```
- in place of A, any identifier can be used
- we can have multiple type params for a class
```
class MyMap[key, val]{
}

trait MyList[A]{
}
```
- generic methods
	- takes type parameters
	- no formal definition given, I believe methods which take type parameters are called generic methods
```
object MyList { // companion object
def empty[A]: MyList[A] = ??? // generic method
}

val emptyList = MyList.empty[Int]
```
- with generic classes and methods, there is variance problem attached
```
class Animal
class Dog extends Animal
class Cat extends Animal

class MyList[A]
```
- can the `MyList[Cat]` be used in place of `MyList[Animal]`, something like the following
	- `val animalList: MyList[Animal] = new MyList[Cat]`?
		- normally with the existing class definitions above, this code errors out
	- but the answer is yes, this behavior is called covariance, and it would require a small change in the code:
```
class MyList[+A] // +A makes the class covariant #doubt 
val animalList: MyList[Animal] = new MyList[Cat]
```
- covariance allows us to substitute a child type for the parent type in a generic class ^ce1c9c
	- another question arises which can be illustrated with the animalList, does animalList.add(new Dog) work?
		- in theory I should be able to add any Animal, but adding a dog to a list of cats pollutes it


- can the `MyList[Cat]` and `MyList[Animal]` be treated as two different objects, without being able to use one in place of the other?
	- yes, the behavior here is called invariance
	- ```class myInvariantList[A]```
	- the default definition is a invariant class definition
	- prohibits child type being substituted for the parent type
- can the `MyList[Animal]` be used in place of `MyList[Cat]`?
	- by default definition of generic class, it is not possible
	- but changes in the generic class definition allows us to enable the above behavior which is called contravariance
	- ```class myContraVariantList[-A]```
	- ```val myCatList: myContraVariantList[Cat] = new myContraVariantList[Animal]```
	- this definition of generic class allows substitution of parent type for the child type while instantiating objects of the generic class
		- this substitution is definitely not possible with normal classes, the following errors our
		- `val myOB: Cat = new Animal`
	- trainer who can train animals can also train a cat
- bounded types
	- allow us to use the generic classes only for certain types which are either a subclass or a superclass of a certain type
	- `class Cage[A <: Animal](animal: A)`
		- this restricts A to be a subclass of Animal or Animal itself
			- to instantiate: `val myN = new boundedList[Animal](myAnimal)`
		- the above class can be instantiated like the following:
		- `val cage = new Cage(new Dog)`
			- this also worked to instantiate
- within the same scope there cannot be a class and trait with the same name

- doubt above
	- I am not sure if `+A makes the class covariant` statement is right? can a class be covariant
	- ```class boundedList1[A <: Animal](obj: Dog); val myL = new boundedList1(myDog)```
		- worked fine, confusing
