- [abstract type members](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/abstract-type-members.html)
	- abstract types such as traits and abstract classes can have abstract type members
	- this means the concrete implementations define the actual types
	- I have not gone much into this
```
trait Buffer:
	type T
	val element T
```

- upper type bounds
	- type parameters(in generics) and abstract type members may be constrained by a type bound
	- type bounds limit the concrete values of the type variables
		- and possibly reveal more information about the members of such types
	- `T<:A` defines that type variable T refers to a subtype of type A
	- this allows A to be passed as the type as well
- [lower type bounds](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/lower-type-bounds.html)
	- declares a type to be a supertype of another type
	- `B>: A` expresses the type parameter B to be a super type of A
	- in most cases, A will be the type parameter of the class and B will be the type parameter of a method
	- I have not gone in-depth as it was pretty complex
```
class Animal{  
  def name = "Animal"  
}  
class Dog extends Animal {  
  override def name = "Doggie"  
}  
class Cat extends Animal {  
  override def name = "Pussy"  
}  
  
class Car
class upper[T<:Animal]  
class lower[T>: Cat]  
val u = new upper[Animal] 
val u1 = new upper[Cat]
val l = new lower[Cat]
val l1 = new lower[Animal]
val l1 = new lower[Car] // error
val u1 = new lower[Car] // error
```
- bounded type restrict a class's usage for particular types while variances do not impost any type from the start
- bounded types help us solve the following problem
	- in covariance we know that the subtype can be used in place of a supertype
	- let's say following is defined
		- `val num: MyList[Animal] = new MyList[Cat]`
	- what if I want to add a dog to this list of cats, as the type suggests I would want a Animal list back 
	- now to make my list to be able to tackle the situation where the user would want to add a dog to the list(it is a normal case as we have defined num to be a Animal list)
```
class MyList[+A](val vale: A){  
  def add[B>:A](n: B) = MyList[B](n)  
}
```
- nothing is a proper substitute for any type
	- nothing is a subtype of every type in scala, even the ones that we define
