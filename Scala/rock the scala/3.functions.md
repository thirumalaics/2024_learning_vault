```
def aFunction(a: String, b: Int): String = {// function definition or signature
	a+ " " +b
}

println(aFunction("Hello", 3))
```
- it is not necessary to define return type like in the above, we can remove it and the compiler does not complain
	- not true for recursive functions
- calling a function is also an expression
- functions that do not take any arguments can be called with just their name without the parentheses
	- this behavior is only allowed in scala 2
	- from scala 3 onwards(which is the version that I have):
		- functions defined with parentheses(even if they do not have any arguments) must be called with parentheses
		- functions defined without parentheses must be called without parentheses
```
println(aParantheseslessFunction)
def aParantheseslessFunction: Int = 22  
println(aParantheseslessFunction)
```
- surprisingly the above code worked without any errors
	- in the above there are two things:
		- parentheses less function, defined without parantheses can only be used without parantheses
		- a function called before the snippet where the function is defined
- I am still unsure on how to write a proper if elif else
- the following is the way to write if else if, else statement in scala 3
	- the syntax is different for scala 2
```
if x < 0 then
	println("vanakkam")
else if x == 0 then
	println("sonakkam")
else
	print("poda venna")

// scala 2 code below, add {} paranthesis for pure scala 2 syntax
if (x < 0)
	println("vanakkam")
else if (x == 0)
	println("sonakkam")
else
	println("poda venna")
```
- fundamental idea of functional programming is to use recursion when we need loops
	- one important rule is that when writing recursion function it is important to provide the function return type
- Unit is a valid return type of functions
	- it can be used to denote that there are side effects in the function
- a function can be defined inside another function just like in python
	- think of it like this, the function body is a code block assigned to the function name variable
	- def can be thought of like a key word denoting that we are dealing with a function
```
def parentFunction(n: Int): Int = {  
  def nsquare(n2: Int, n1: Int): Int = {  
    n*n1  
  }  
  nsquare(n,n-1)  
}
```
- the above function works without any issue
	- see that I am referencing a variable from the parent function in the nested function
```
def fn(x: Any) = {  
  if x.getClass == Int then  
    if x  == 1 then 1 else 2  
  else  
    if x == "a" then "a" else "C"  
}
// return type of this function is Any
// I was not able to use comparison operators because Any type does not have them defined

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12560463/return-in-scala - look into this, I did not read and write notes for this as it is very concise and to the point
- return statements are generally 
	- not a ubiquitous answer on whether to abstain from using a return statement
	- research for later if needed or ask people
