## String Interpolators
- string interpolation allows us to use variables inside strings
- there are different interpolators
	- a string interpolator is just a special method, so it is possible to define our own
- S-Interpolators
	- only to use variables directly in string
```
val name = "David"
val age = 3
val sentence = s"Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old"
val sentence2 = s"Hello, my name is $name and I am turning ${age + 1}"
```
- the string `sentence` is called as s-interpolated string
	- s-interpolated string can evaluate ***complex*** expressions
	- what happens is $name and $age placeholders in the string are replaced by the results of calling name.toString and age.toString respectively
	- s string will have access to all variables that are currently in scope
	- for some special characters, it is necessary to escape them when embedded within a string
	- to represent an actual dollar sign `$$`
- there are other interpolated strings available
	- F-Interpolators
		- act as s-interpolators but they also accept printf like formats
		- all variable references ***should be*** followed by a printf-style format string
			- like %d
			- but if nothing given, %s is assumed as the default
		- `val myth = f"$name%s can eat $speed%2.2f"`
			- I am not sure what the 2 before decimal means but the 2 after dot means two decimal places
			- I changed the first 2 to 1 and it had no effect
				- first 2 means(as per course): 2 characters total, minimum 
		- %s is not mandatory
		- f-interpolated strings can also check for type correctness in the strings that they expand
			- f interpolators are type safe
				- if we try passing a format string that only works for integers but pass a double, the compiler will issue a error
		- something like the following will fail: `val x= 1.1f; val str = f"$x%3d"`
			- the d above means int
		- f interpolator makes use of the string format utilities available from java
			- refer formatter javadoc to see what is allowed after the \%
		- since % has different meaning, we will have to use \%% to get a literal %
	- raw interpolator
		- acts similar to s-interpolator but can print chars literally without escaping of literals within the string
			- chars like \\n are by default escaped in strings
		- `println(raw"this is a \n line")`
			- the same behaviour is not expected here: `val escaped = "This is a \n newline"; println(raw"$escaped")`
			- the result here is printed on two lines


## OO Basics
- classes are written outside the object implementation
	- but they can written inside as well, irrespective of whether the object extends app or defines it's own main method
- classes themselves can contain methods, values, variables, types, objects, traits and classes which are collectively called members
- class names should be capitalized
- class def can sit on the top level code
- `class Person`  this is a class definition, this class can be instantiated by
	- `val p = new Person`
	- from scala 3, the following instantiation is sufficient: `val p = Person()`
	- the person class defined here has a default constructor which takes no arguments because no constructor was defined
- `class Person(name:String, age: Int) // constructor`
	- this class can be instantiated by `val person = new Person("John", 24)`
	- but we cannot run the following without error: person.age
		- ***here*** the name and age are class parameters and not class member
- to convert a class parameter to a class field: `class Person(val/var name: String, val/var age: Int)`
	- this allows us to access name or age using the dot notation
	- remove val/var from parameters that do not have to be fields of a class
		- in class constructors we can have some fields and some parameters, the order does not seem to matter
```
class Person(name: String, val age: Int){
//body delimited by {}
// body here is not expressions themselves
} the parameters at the top and statements in the body make up the constructor
```
- the body of class can have variable and function definitions, expressions and so on
	- the value of the code block is ignored
	- in the body we can do anything that we would do in a code block
- ***value or var definitions*** inside the class creates fields that can be accessed using the dot notation
- at every instantiation, the whole block of code for the class is evaluated
	- including all the expression, with or without side effects
- methods are also called using the dot notation
```
object OObasics extends App {  
  val myP = new Person("Thiru", 34)  
//  println(myP.name)  
  println(myP.s)  // second output
  myP.fn("Vanakkam")  
}  
  
class Person(name: String, age: Int) {  
  println(6+9)   // first op
  val s = 21  
  
    def fn(name: String): Unit = println(s"${this.name} greets $name") // 3rd op, notice the usage of `this` even though name is not a class field
}
```
- `this` is used as `self` here
	- `this.name` is not a class field(meaning it is still a parameter) but it is available within the class def
		- irrespective of name being a class field or not
	- we are using `this` here because there is a method param with the same name `name`
	- if there is no conflicting parameter name, then we can avoid using this.
		- `this` is implied in this case
- overloading: defining methods with same name but ***diff signatures***(different num of params or diff param types)
	- one case of confusion is when two methods with same signature returns two diff types of values
		- in this call error
		- strictly arguments must be diff
		- only different return type does not allow overloading
