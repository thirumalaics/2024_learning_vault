## String Interpolators
- S-Interpolators
```
val name = "David"
val age = 3
val sentence = s"Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old"
val sentence2 = s"Hello, my name is $name and I am turning ${age + 1}"
```
- the string sentence is called as s-interpolated string
	- s-interpolated string can evaluate complex expressions
- there are other interpolated strings available
	- F-Interpolators
		- act as s-interpolators but they also accept printf like formats
		- `val myth = f"$name%s can eat $speed%2.2f"`
			- I am not sure what the 2 before decimal means but the 2 after dot means two decimal places
			- I changed the first 2 to 1 and it had no effect
				- first 2 means(as per course): 2 characters total, minimum 
		- %s is not mandatory
		- f-interpolated strings can also check for type correctness in the strings that they expand
		- something like the following will fail: `val x= 1.1f; val str = f"$x%3d"`
			- the d above means int
	- raw interpolator
		- acts similar to s-interpolator but can print chars literally
			- chars like \\n are by default escaped in strings
		- `println(raw"this is a \n line")`
			- the same behaviour is not expected here: `val escaped = "This is a \n newline"; println(raw"$escaped")`
			- the result here is printed on two lines


## OO Basics
- classes are written outside the object implementation
- class def can sit on the top level code
- `class Person`  this is a class definition, this class can be instantiated by
	- `val p = new Person`
- `class Person(name:String, age: Int) // constructor`
	- this class can be instantiated by `val person = new Person("John", 24)`
	- but we cannot run the following without error: person.age
		- ***here*** the name and age are class parameters and not class member
- to convert a class parameter to a class field: `class Person(val/var name: String, val/var age: Int)`
	- this allows use to access name or age using person.age
	- remove val/var from parameters that do not have to be fields of a class
		- in class constructors we can have some fields and some parameters, the order does not seem to matter
```
class Person(name: String, val age: Int){
//body delimited by {}
// body here is not expressions themselves
}
```
- the body of class can have variable and function definitions, expressions and so on
	- the value of the code block is ignored
	- in the body we can do anything that we would do in a code block
- value or var definitions inside the class creates fields that can be accessed using the dot notation
- at every instantiation, the whole block of code for the class is evaluated
	- including all the expression, with or without side effects
- methods are also called using the dot notation
`def fn(name: String): Unit = println(s"${this.name} greets $name")`
- this is used as self here
	- this.name is not a class field(meaning it is still a parameter) but it is available within the class def
		- irrespective of name being a class field or not
	- we are using this here because there is a method param with the same name
	- if there is no conflicting parameter name, then we can avoid using this.
		- this is implied in this case
- overloading: defining methods with same name but ***diff signatures***(different num of params or diff param types)
	- one case of confusion is when two methods with same signature returns two diff types of values
		- in this call error
		- strictly arguments must be diff
		- only different return type does not allow overloading
