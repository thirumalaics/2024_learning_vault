- ultimate abstract datatype
- created using the keyword `trait` followed by the trait name
- just like abstract classes, traits have abstract members
- diff bw traits and abstract classes
	- unlike abstract classes, traits can be inherited along with other classes
	- `class Crocodile extends Animal with carnivore`
		- class crocodile inherits members from Animal and carnivore
		- the members in both Animal(abstract class in this case) and carnivore need to be implemented in Crocodile
	- multiple traits can be extended:
		- `class Crocodile extends Animal with carnivore with ColdBlooded`
	- when extending only a trait, the with keyword did not seem to work, I had to use the extends keyword
		- `class Cat extends ColdBlooded`
	- traits cannot have constructor params(until scala3, post which it is possible)
	- scala supports single-class inheritance, multiple trait inheritance
		- no multiclass inheritance
- similarities bw abstract and non-abstract members
	- abstract classes can have abstract and non-abstract members
		- so if the abstract class has a non-abstract member, when extending the child class has to use override keyword for that particular member
	- traits can also have non-abstract members
- when to choose trait/abstract class?
	- we chose a trait instead of an abstract class if what we want to do describes a type of behavior
	- traits for behavior and abstract class for thing
	- still now clear
- there are some doubts
	- when to use extends and with
	- is multiple inheritance not possible? - answered above
		- multiple inheritance is possible only via traitrs
	- what is the difference between trait and abstract class?
		- check above for more detail

- scala's type hierarchy
	- all classes that we write derive from AnyRef(mapped to java's object type) unless we say that the class extends some other class of ours
		- ex: String, List, Set all derive from AnyRef
	- Null type derives from every type of AnyRef
		- we can replace any other type with null as a value
	- AnyVal type contains all primitives such as int, Unit, boolean etc..
		- all primitives extend AnyVal
	- derived from all of the above types is Nothing
		- subtype of every other type in scala above
		- means no instance of anything at all, not even null 
		- there are expressions returning nothing
- objects can extend classes
- an equivalent of pass in scala
```
object Empty extends MyList {
def head: Int = ???
}
```
- to raise an exception in python = throw an exception in Scala
	- `throw new NoSuchElementException`
	- these expressions return nothing type
- the exercise for this lecture was pretty easy is what I felt, but that guy's solution is very complicated
- toString, equaly and hashCode methods are present in anyRef class
	- we need to use override keyword if we plan to use methods of same name
