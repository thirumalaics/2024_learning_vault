- ultimate abstract datatype
- traits cannot be instantiated
- similar to Interfaces in java
	- is a reference type similar to a class that is used to specify a set of methods that a class must implement
- as per official scala doc: traits are used to share interfaces and fields bw classes
- created using the keyword `trait` followed by the trait name
- just like abstract classes, traits have abstract members
- diff bw traits and abstract classes
	- both of these constructs are provided to enable behavior reuse across multiple classes
	- unlike abstract classes, traits can be inherited along with other classes and multiple traits can be inherited
		- it means to say multi-class inheritance is not possible whereas multi-trait inheritance is possible
	- `class Crocodile extends Animal with carnivore`
		- class Crocodile inherits members from Animal and carnivore
		- the members in both Animal(abstract class in this case) and carnivore need to be implemented in Crocodile
	- multiple traits can be extended:
		- `class Crocodile extends Animal with carnivore with ColdBlooded`
	- when extending only a trait, the with keyword did not seem to work, I had to use the extends keyword
		- `class Cat extends ColdBlooded`
		- backed by [scala doc](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/traits.html)
	- traits cannot have constructor params(until scala3, post which it is possible)
	- scala supports single-class inheritance, multiple trait inheritance
		- no multiclass inheritance
	- scala abstract classes are fully interoperable with java
		- java code can directly call abstract scala classes and subclasses without any work arounds 
	- abstract classes and traits can contain fully defined members or abstract members
	- traits not quite the same as interfaces in java and we need to find minor workarounds when we try to use them from java
		- traits are fully interoperable only if they do not contain any implementation code
	- [ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1991042/what-is-the-advantage-of-using-abstract-classes-instead-of-traits)
- when inheriting a trait, abstract members can be defined in the child class without having to use override keyword
	- fields in trait can be var or val, and when inheriting also it can be var or val
	- but if the var is defined in the trait or abstract class, we cannot override it in the child class
```
abstract class xx {  
  def count: Int  
  var xxx: Int  
  var y: Int = 10  
}
class parent extends xx {  
  def count: Int = 1  
  var xxx: Int = 100
  override var y = 10 // this is where the error is  
}
```

- similarities bw abstract and non-abstract members
	- abstract classes can have abstract and non-abstract members
		- so if the abstract class has a non-abstract member, when extending the child class has to use override keyword for that particular member
	- traits can also have non-abstract members


- when to choose trait/abstract class?
	- we chose a trait instead of an abstract class if what we want to do describes a type of behavior
		- if we need a reusable component in several unrelated classes
	- traits for behavior and abstract class for thing
- there are some doubts
	- when to use `extends` and `with`?
		- when we have multiple classes or traits to inherit, first is always extends
		- extends can work with classes or traits
		- following the first class/trait to be extended, we can use `with`
		- if we have classes and traits to be extended, first should always be a class extended using extends and following which no more classes can be inherited to the derived class
		- `with` can only be used along with extends
			- `class C7 extends P1 with T1 with T2` reads `class C7 extends (P1 with T1 with T2)`.
		- [ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41031166/scala-extends-vs-with)
	- is multiple inheritance not possible? - answered above
		- multiple inheritance is possible only via traits
	- what is the difference between trait and abstract class?
		- i have explained above, [ref](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/traits-vs-abstract-classes)


- [scala's type hierarchy](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/type-hierarchies)
	- ![[Pasted image 20241027114511.png]]
	- all classes that we write derive from AnyRef(mapped to java's object type) unless we say that the class extends some other class of ours
		- ex: String, List, Set all derive from AnyRef
	- Null type derives from every type of AnyRef
		- we can replace any other type with null as a value
	- AnyVal type contains all primitives such as int, Unit, boolean etc..
		- all primitives extend AnyVal
	- derived from all of the above types is Nothing
		- subtype of every other type in scala above
		- means no instance of anything at all, not even null 
		- there are expressions returning nothing
- objects can extend classes
- an equivalent of pass in scala
```
object Empty extends MyList {
def head: Int = ???
}
```
- to raise an exception in python = throw an exception in Scala
	- `throw new NoSuchElementException`
	- these expressions return nothing type
- the exercise for this lecture was pretty easy is what I felt, but that guy's solution is very complicated
- toString, equaly and hashCode methods are present in anyRef class
	- we need to use override keyword if we plan to use methods of same name
