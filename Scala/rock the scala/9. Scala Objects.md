- the course guy avoided calling the instances of classes as objects till this point
- one of the important oop feature is class level functionality
	- functionality that does not depend on instance of a class
- i believe he is talking about class methods and vars
	- yes he is, in java terms it is called static methods and vars
- Scala does not have class level functionality
	- it has something even better: object
- the following class and objects and everything are defined under the object
```
object Person{
	val N_EYES = 2
	def canFly: Boolean = false
	def apply(mother: Person, father: Person): Person = new Person(s"$mother.name  $father.name")
}
class Person(val name: string) {
	// instance level functionality
}
println(Person.N_EYES)
println(Person.canFly)

var mary = Person // see below
var john = Person

println(mary == john) // prints true

var mary1 = new Person("mary")
var john1 = new Person("John")

println(mary1 == john1) // prints false
```
- the above code snippet is similar to class variable
- the above object can have values, vars and method definitions
	- as seen above
	- objects can be defined just like how a class would be defined with the exception that objects do not receive parameters
		- where as class can receive parameters
	- these vals, vars and methods can be accessed like a class variable and method
- to use class level definitions in scala, we use Objects
- scala object is a singleton instance
	- when we define an object Person, we define it's type and also it's only instance
	- the object is it's own type and it's own instance
- see above
	- the object pointed by Person variable is assigned to mary
	- same is done to the john var
	- when the equality is checked bw the object pointed by both these variables, it is true
	- as both variables are pointing to the same object
- we can write class with the same name Person in the same scope
	- this is to separate instance level and class level functionality
	- writing a class and object with the same name and scope is called companions
	- while defining the companion class, it is not necessary for the class to have parameters
	- every method, var that will ever be accessed from some kind of instance
		- either singleton instance or regular instance
- when only the object is defined, ex Person, Person is the only instance of it's type
	- when we define a companion class for this object Person, Person(object) is not the only instance of it's type
	- really confusing this is in the 14th lecture
	- mary and john above are two different instances 
	- singleton objects are objects that can be referred to with the name that was given to them in definition
- Conventionally factory methods are defined in the singleton objects
	- usually the singleton object has a factory method to generate an object using the companion class
	- such a method is usually called apply method(method name is given as apply)
		- this allows the object to be called as Person("blah")

- scala applications are scala objects with the main method which receives an array of string as an argument or object which extends App
	- the def looks something like: `def main(args: Array[String]): Unit`
	- the main method needs to have the above definition because scala apps are converted into jvm applications whose entry point has to be `public static void main` with array of string as parameter
		- void equivalent in scala is unit
		- static in java is equivalent to plain method in scala objects
			- because static method means methods that are associated with a class but not with a specific instance of the class
			- static methods can be called without creating an object first
			- and remember methods and vars defined under Singletons are class methods and vars
	- without the `extends App`, we need to define our own main method with array of strings as parameter
		- all code needs to be put under the main method now
			- not necessarily all code, check the code immediately below
			- output is I want it more first and then HUMILITY 
	- extending app turns the entire object body into main method
	- App is called a trait and it is a convenient way to create an executable scala program
	- while using the App trait, delayed initialization feature is used
```
object checkIt {  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {  
    val x = "HUMILITY"  
    println(x)  
  }  
  println("I want it more")  
}
```
- companions can access each other's private members
	- all the code we write can be accessed only through an instance of something
```
object Tindu {  
  private var x = 1  
}  
  
class Tindu{  
  var y = Tindu.x  
  Tindu.x = 12  
}
```
- main method is the entry point of a scala program
	- jvm requires a main method, named main that takes one argument: array of strings
	- main methods are written only in object not in class
	- importance of main method:
		- OS and runtime env need to know where to begin execution, main method provides a well-defined starting point
		- makes the structure of program predictable even for developers
	- the array of strings that main method receives is the array of cmd line arguments passed when executing the program
	- by using a dedicated entry point it becomes easier to separate the program's initialization logic from other parts of the code
	- python executes code top-to-bottom in a more sequential manner
		- less formalized than languages that target compiled bytecode execution like java or scala

```
package part2oop  


object objects {  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {  
    println("Sexy")  
  }  
}

object sexy{  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {  
    println("Actual sexy")  
  }  
}
```

- the above code only outputs Sexy
	- important to note that the file name was objects
		- only the main method of objects is executed
	- sexy object was also in the same file as objects object
- within a package, I can use Object and class references from other files without having to import them first

- doubt #doubt 
	- what is delayed initialization?
	- can an Singleton Object's variable's value be changed?
		- yes if they are var
		- similar to class variables in python
	- what are scala apps?
		- objects with main method(args: Array[String]) or that extending App
