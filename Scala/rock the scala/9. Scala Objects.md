- the course guy avoided calling the instances of classes as objects till this point
- one of the important oop feature is class level functionality
	- functionality that does not depend on instance of a class
- i believe he is talking about class methods and vars
- Scala does not have class level functionality
	- it has something even better: object
```
object Person{
	val N_EYES = 2
	def canFly: Boolean = false
}
class Person{
// instance level functionality
}
println(Person.N_EYES)
println(Person.canFly)

var mary = Person // see below
var john = Person

println(mary == john) // prints true
```
- the above code snippet is similar to class variable
- the above object can have values, vars and method definitions
	- as seen above
	- objects can be defined just like how a class would be defined with the exception that objects do not receive parameters
	- these vals, vars and methods can be accessed like a class variable and method
- to use class level definitions in scala, we use Objects
- scala object is a singleton instance
	- when we define an object Person, we define it's type and also it's only instance
	- the object is it's own type and it's own instance
- see below
	- the instance pointed by Person variable is assigned to mary
	- same is done to the john var
	- when the equality is checked bw the object pointed by both these variables, it is true
	- as both variables are pointing to the same object
- we can write class with the same name Person in the same scope
	- this is to separate instance level and class level functionality
	- writing a class and object with the same name and scope is called companions
