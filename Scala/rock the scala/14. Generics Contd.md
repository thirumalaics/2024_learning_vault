- generic classes
	- are classes which take type as an argument
	- typically useful for collection classes
	- assuming the push method is defined in the below class, child types can be passed in as well to be added to the collection
	- `Stack[A]` is a subtype of `Stack[B]` if and only if B=A

```
class Stack[A]
class Fruit
class Apple extends Fruit
class Banana extends Fruit

val stack = new Stack[Fruit]
val apple = Apple()
val banana = Banana()
stack.push(apple)
stack.push(banana)
```

- generic methods are defined similar to generic class
	- they accept type as a parameter
```
object MyList{
	def empty[A]: List[A] = List.empty[A]
}

val list: List[Int] = MyList.empty[Int]
```
- generics in general are parameterized types to create flexible and reusable components

- What is the difference between class and a type?
	- Class is something that can be instantiated
		- singleton objects, traits and interfaces are commonly considered to be classes
		- classes are primary unit of design in most OOPL
	- every possible value that the system can express will have one or more types
		- and these can sometimes be equated to classes
		- `"hello World"` class and type are String
		- this.type always refers to the unique type of this
			- it is unique to the single instance and is not compatible with other instances of the same class
- subtyping refers to the relationship bw diff types where one type can be substituted for another in certain contexts
	- if Lion is a subtype of Animal, wherever Animal is expected Lion can be used instead without causing errors
	- subtyping ensures, wherever a subtype is expected, a  supertype can be safely used
- variance let's us control how type parameters behave with regards to subtyping
- scala supports variance annotations of type parameters of generic classes to allow them to be covariant, contravariant, or invariant if no annotations are used
- as far as my understanding goes, variance allows us to control whether a type can be substituted for it's subtype or it's super type

```
/// class def for variance
class Box[A](var content: A)
abstract class Animal{
	def name: String
}
class Cat(name: String) extends Animal
class Dog(name: String) extends Animal
```
- invariance
	- property of a class which does not allow object of generic class of subtype to be used in place of object of generic class of super type
```
val catBox: Box[Cat] = new Box[Cat](Cat("felix"))
val animalBox: Box[Animal] = catBox
```
- assume  that the above worked
- now both catBox and animalBox are pointing to the same object
- since Animal box is a super type of dog as well, I should be able to change the the content to hold a Dog
	- `animalBox.content = new Dog("fredo")`
	- it would have been fine if the animalBox is pure Animal box but since in this case it is a cat box, and we cannot put a Dog inside a cat box which breaks the type soundness
- from this we conclude that `Box[Cat]` and `Box[Animal]` can't have subtyping relationship, even though Cat and ANimal do
- invariance as a textbook definition:
	- given `class Inv[A]`, `Inv[A]` can be used in place of `Inv[B]` only if A = B

```
class myGeneric[A](var myBoi: A) // here var is permissable
var objA: myGeneric[Animal] = new myGeneric[Animal](new Animal("Simon's mother"))  
var objj: myGeneric[Animal] = new myGeneric[Animal](new Animal("Manoj"))  
objj = objA
```
