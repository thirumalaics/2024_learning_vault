- Seq
	- a very general Interface for data structures that 
		- have a well defined order
		- can be indexed
	- supports various operations:
		- apply, iterator, length, reverse for indexing and iterating
		- concatenation, appending, prepending
		- a lot of others: grouping, sorting, zipping, searching, slicing
	- when I print out the sequence it's string repr says it is a list
		- in the following snippet we are using the apply method of Seq companion object
```
val aSequence = Seq(1,2,3,4)
println(aSequence) // List(1,2,3,4)
println(aSequence.reverse) // obviously reverses the list
println(aSequence(0)) // fetches the first element in the sequence
// he mentioned we are applying apply method above


println(aSequence ++ Seq(5,6,7)) // concat
println(Seq(4,3,2,1).sorted) // ascending
println(Seq(1,2,3,4).sorted(Ordering[Int].reverse)) // descending
```
- range
	- is a sequence
	- `val aRange: Seq[Int] = 1 to 10`
		- the able is a collection which is a range
		- the return type of the to method when inspected is Range.Inclusive
			- this includes the upper limit that we give
```
val aRange = 1 to 10   // inferred type is Range.Inclusive
println(aRange) // Range 1 to 10
val aRange1: Seq[Int] = 1 to 10
println(aRange1) // Range 1 to 10
aRange.foreach(println)  
aRange1.foreach(println) // both print the same output

val newRange = 1 until 10 // 10 is non inclusive
```
- Nil is the empty case object of type `List[Nothing]`
- `::[A]` list case class definition
- both of the above xtend a sealed abstract class `List[+A]`
- Lists are immutable and extend LinearSeq
	- these are linked List
	- head, tail, isEmpty methods are fast O(1)
	- getting an element at a given index, length and reverse are linear time
- list, seq and ranges accept only homogenous elements
```
val aList = List(1,2,3)
val prepended = 43 :: aList // infix syntactic sugar for apply only used for prepending
val prepended1 = 43 +: aList // infix operator for prepending
val appended = aList :+ 89
```
- : is always facing the list
- to get a list of same elements
```
println(List.fill(5)("Apple"))
```
- mkString method is available on all the above collections: List, Range, Seq
```
aList.mkString("-")
aSequence.mkString("Start(", "-", ")")
```

- Arrays
	- equivalent of simple java arrays
	- can be manually constructed with predefined lengths
	- can be mutated
	- are interoperable with java's native arrays
	- indexing is fast
	- array is a sequence even though programmatically arrays do not extend Seq
```
val anArray = Array(1,2,3,4)
val fixedArray = Array.ofDim[Int](4) // initialized with zeros
```
- arrays when printed are cryptic in nature
	- we have to use mkString method to make sense of arrays
	- foreach also works
- false as a default value for array of bool
- string arrays have null as a default value
- mutation is as follows:
```
val myArray = Array(1,2,3,4)
myArray(2) = 0 // syntactic sugar for numbers.update(2,0)
```
- Arrays are direct mapping of Java arrays
```
val numbers = Array(1,2,3,4)
val aSequenceArray: Seq[Int] = numbers // what happens here is implicit conversion
println(aSequenceArray) // WrappedArray(1,2,0,4)
```
- WrappedArrays are special kind of sequence that wraps over an array
- implicit conversions happen behind the scenes so that arrays have access to Seq methods such as mkString as an example
- vector
	- default implementation for immutable sequences
	- very efficient
	- effectively constant indexed read and write: O(log32(n))
	- fast element additions for append and prepend
	- implemented as a fixed-branched trie (branch factor 32)
		- at any one level 32 elements are held
	- good performance for large sizes
