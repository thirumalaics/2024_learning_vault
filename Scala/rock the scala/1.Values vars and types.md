- all files that I created for this learning day are of scala class object file
```
object ValuesVariablesTypes extends App{

}
```
- above extends App is equivalent to creating a main function, which makes this application runnable
- an alternative way is to skip `extends App` and in the body of the object inside {}, type in main, then hit ctrl-space to generate the function that will be called when running the app
	- `def main(args: Array[String])`
- variables declared using the keyword val cannot be reassigned
	- vals are immutable
	- vals are similar to final in java and const in c
	- vals are not literally regarded as constants, they are more like intermediate computations to later use in bigger computations
- types of vals are optional
	- compiler can ***infer*** type from the right
	- `val x = 42`
	- he also mentioned for vars in a separate statement, compiler can infer type
	- `val x: Int = "hello there"` this will obviously show in red in ide
- semicolons are necessary if we write multiple expressions on the same line
	- not recommended to write such expressions
- Basic data types: Boolean, String, Int,Char,Short, Long, Float, Double
- boolean accepts `true` or `false`
- Char objects are single character value enclosed by ***single quotes***
- Short is smaller version of Int
	- compiler will complain if the number is too big
	- 1/2 the representation of int
- Long
	- double the repr of int
	- to mark big numbers as long, we need to mark them with L in the end:
		- 34567890456789L
			- not necessary
		- same syntax as Java
	- even though I get a red mark below, I was able to run the program without an issue
	- ![[Pasted image 20240903191645.png]]
- Float
	- 2.0f
		- I initialized without giving f and it did not complain even b4 running
		- if I give multiple trailing zeros with or without f, the output is 2.0
		- he mentions that if the f is not given, the number is interpreted as double and not as a float
			- it is true, without the trailing f, the type of the variable is assigned to `Double` as default
	- f marks the value as float, otherwise the IDE will complain
		- not complaints seen till now
- vars are mutable
	- hence reassignment to variables is possible
	- variables are used in fnal programming for side effects
	- side effects are useful because they allow us to see what our program is doing
		- side effects can involve either of the following: changing variable, printing something
		- programs without side effects are easier to understand
- double definitions are not allowed, variables with same name cannot be defined in a script
	- even if they are defined with same value and type
