- the catch in the try catch is actually match of pattern matching

```
try {
// something
} catch {
	case e: RuntimeException => "runtime"
	case npe: NullPointerException => "npe"
	case _ => "something else"
}
the above code is as if: 
/* 
try {
	// code
} catch (e) {
	e match {
		case e: RuntimeException => "runtime"
		case npe: NullPointerException => "npe"
		case _ => "something else"
	}
}
```

- the following code returns a `List[Int]`
```
val tmp = for {  
  x <- l if x %2 == 0   // based on pattern matching
} yield x * 10

val lt = List((1,2), (3,4))
println(for {
	(first, second) <- lt // pattern matching again
} yield first * second)
```
- the tuple are decomposed to its constituents just like how pattern matching would do
	- in the for comprehension, other pattern matching decomposition applicable for case classes and :: is available as well
```
for {  
  e1 :: e2 <- lt  
} {  
  println(s"e1 is ${e1}")  
  println(s"e2 is ${e2}")  
}

// e1 is List(1)
// e2 is List(List(2, 3))
// e1 is List(3, 4)
// e2 is List()

case class Person(name: String, age: Int)  
  
val lcc = List(  
  Person("Thiru", 25),  
  Person("Nayanu", 26),  
  Person("Niya", 15)  
)  
  
for {  
  Person(x, y) <- lcc  
}{  
  println(s"My name is ${x} and I am ${y} years old")  
}

// My name is Thiru and I am 25 years old
// My name is Nayanu and I am 26 years old
// My name is Niya and I am 15 years old
```

- unpacking of tuple also uses pattern matching
	- not limited to tuples
```
val tup = (1,2,3)
val a,v,i = tup // this will assign (1,2,3) to each variable
val (a,v,i) = tup // this will assign 1 to a, 2 to v, 3 to i

val aList = List(1,2,3)
val head :: tail = aList
println(head) // 1
println(tail) // List(2,3)
```

- partial function literal are based on pattern matching
```
val mappedList = aList.map{
	case 1 => "The one"
	case v if v %2 == 0 => s"${v} is even"
	case _ => "something else"
}
// a mappedlist List(The one, 2 is even, something else)
the above code is equivalent to 

val mappedList = aList.map(x => x match {
	case 1 => "The one"
	case v if v %2 == 0 => s"${v} is even"
	case _ => "something else"
})
```

## Braceless Syntax
- scala 3 feature

```
// scala 2
val anIfExpression = if (2>3) "bigger" else "smaller"
val anIfExpressionV2= 
	if (2> 3) {
		"bigger"
	} else {
		"smaller"
	}
val ifExpressionV3 = 
	if (2 > 3) "bigger"
	else "smaller"

// scala 3
val ifExp = if 2 > 3 then
	"bigger"
else
	"smaller"
val ifExpV1 = 
if 2 > 3 then
	val res = "bigger"
	res
else
	val res = "smaller"
	res

val ifExpV2 = if 2 > 3 then "bigg" else "small"
```
- main difference with ifExp is the introduction of the then keyword
	- we let go of the braces
	- the expressions that we return on every branch must be significantly indented with respect to the initial if structure
		- either a space or tab or multiple of these
	- we still need to keep track of the indentation region as it has it's own scope
```
val forComp = for {
 n <- List(1,2,3)
 s <- List("black", "white")
} yield s"${n} ${s}"

val forComp1 = 
for
	n <- List(1,2,3)
	s <- List("black", "white")
yield s"${n}${s}"
```


```
val aVal = 42
println(aVal match {
	case 1 => "the one"
	case 2 => "double or nothing"
	case _ => "something else"
})

println(aVal match 
	case 1 => "the one"
	case 2 => "double or nothing"
	case _ => "something else"
)
```

- higher indentation than the line in which the match keyword appears

```
def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = 
	val z = x + y
	z
```
- objects, classes, traits, enums and data types with significant indentation, below code is applicable for all these structures
```
class Animal: // colon not necessary
	def eat(): Unit = println("I am ")
	def grow(): Unit = println("I am growing")

/ for larger codes:

class Animal:
	def eat(): Unit = println("I am ")
	def grow(): Unit = println("I am growing")
	def excrete(): Unit =
		println()
	end excrete

end Animal // only applicable if there is a colon after the class name and should be in the same indentation as class


val anAnimal = new Animal:
	override def eat(): Unit = println("Iam special")
// no end token applicable

```

- end token applicable for any for match, if, for, methods, class, enums, traits, objects

```
for  
  x <- List(1,2,3,4)  
do  
  println(x * 2)  
end for
```

```
if 2 > 3  
then  
  println(2*3)  
else  
  println(222)  
end if
```

- either indent with spaces or tabs dont mix both
