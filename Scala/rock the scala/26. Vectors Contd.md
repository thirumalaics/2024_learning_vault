```
val vector: Vector[Int] = Vector(1,2,3)
println(vector) // Vector(1,2,3)
```
- offers many functionalities identical to the other collections
```
val limit = 1000000  
def getAvgWriteTime(collection: Seq[Int]): Double = {  
  val r = new Random()  
  
  val times = 1000  
  
  val timesList = for {  
    i <- 1 to times  
  } yield {  
    val startTime = System.nanoTime()  
    collection.updated(r.nextInt(limit),r.nextInt())  
    System.nanoTime() - startTime  
  }  
  timesList.sum / times  
}
```
- new Random() -> creates a new random number generator
	- this object has many methods like nextDoubt, nextInt
	- the limit passed as an argument in the upper bound value, exclusive
	- this limit must be an integer
- System.nanoTime()
	- this is not time elapsed since linux epoch
	- it is nano seconds elapsed since some arbitrary origin in time
		- this origin can be set in the future as well, so the value returned might be negative
- timesList.sum method calculates the sum of elements of a list or seq
- collection.updated method takes two arguments: first is the index and next is the value to be replaced with
	- this returns a new collection
	- this does not add elements into the collection
	- this method is available in list, vector and array
- notice the argument type: `Seq[Int]`
	- this takes in `Vector[Int], Array[Int], List[Int]`
- UTC is Coordinated Universal Time


```
println(getAvgWriteTime((1 to limit).toList)) // values kept fluctuating bw runs
println(getAvgWriteTime((1 to limit).toArray))// values kept fluctuating bw runs  
println(getAvgWriteTime((1 to limit).toVector))

- list's keep references to tails and updates to head are very fast
	- if we want to update an element in the middle of the list then the performance starts to deteriorate
- Vector will have to replace the 32 node level every time a node is updated
	- hence the constant time it takes to write
