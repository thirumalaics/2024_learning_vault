- a list can be instantiated as follows:
```
val list = List(1,2,3)
println(list) // List(1,2,3)
println(list.head) // 1
println(list.tail) // List(2, 3)
println(list.map(_ + " is a bloodclat number"))
print(list.filter(_ % 2 ==0))  
println(list.flatMap(x => List(x , x*22)))
```
- above apply method is called on the List companion object
- head and tail method available in the above list
- appending elements to a list appends it to the end and not to the start of the list:
```
var newList = list.appended(10)
```
- appended method returns a new list
	- so far I have not found an method which adds elements to list in place
- one important distinction between map and foreach
	- foreach method's arg is expected to return Unit type
	- whereas map method's arg is expected to a list of B type
		- so if I pass a function which returns unit to map, the return type of map is `List[Unit]`
		- `val tmp: List[Unit] = list.map(println(_))`
- filter method returns a list does not filter in place

```
val l1 =List(1,2,3,4)  
val l2 = List("a","b","c","d")  
val l3 = List("Black", "Yellow")

val final_list = for {
n <- l1
c <- l2
color <- l3
} yield "" + c + n + "-" + color
```

- the above is called for comprehension
	- compiler writes the above to the following
	- `l2.flatMap(c => l3.flatMap(color => l1.map(n => "" + c + n + "-" + color)))`
	- to filter while comprehension
```
val final_list1 = for {
n <- l1 if n % 2== 0 // the result only contains concat of even nums
c <- l2
color <- l3
} yield "" + c + n + "-" + color
```
- compiler applies the condition above using a filter
