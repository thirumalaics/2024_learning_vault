- we cannot leave functions un-implemented
	- use null as return value instead: `null`

```
def nTimesBetter(n: Int, f: Int => Int): Int => Int = {  
  
  if n <= 0 then (x:Int) => x  
  else  
    (x: Int) => nTimesBetter(n-1, f)(f(x))  
}  
  
println(nTimesBetter(3, _ + 1)(0))
```
- scala supports definition of functions with multiple parameter list to act like curried functions
	- we can have as may parameter lists as we want
	- for functions with multiple parameter lists, if we want to define smaller fns later we have to specify their type otherwise our code will not compile
		- ex: in the following example without specifying the type for stdFormat, the code will fail
```
def curriedFormater(c: String)(x: Double) : String = c.format(x)

val stdFormat: (Double => String) = curriedFormatter("%4.2f") // now this is fucntion which can later accept values
```
- Pi is accessible through Math.PI
