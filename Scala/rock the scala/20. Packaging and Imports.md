- what is sbt?
	- simple build tool
- why is sbt needed and what it does?
	- when we write small programs that consist of only one, or just two source files, then it's easy enough to compile those source files by `scalac MyProgram.scala`
	- when we start working on a bigger project, then it becomes too tedious to compile all those source files manually
	- sbt is a tool to manage compiling all the source files
	- for it to work, we create a project file that describes what our project looks like
		- this file is build.sbt
		- this file consists all the source files our project consists of, along with other information about the project
		- sbt will read the file and knows what to do to compile the whole project
	- besides managing our project, some build tools, including sbt can help in managing dependencies for us
		- sbt can automatically download the right versions of those libs and include them in our project
- scala uses packages to create namespaces which allow us to modularize programs
- packages are created by declaring one or more package names at the top of a scala file
- one convention is to name the package same as the directory containing the scala file
- package name must be all lower case
- members, such as class, objects, traits, are accessible across files if they belong to the same package
	- when we want to access a member of a package from a file that is not part of the aforementioned package, we need to import the package 
	- even without importing we can reference the member using it's fully qualified name
- packages are hierarchical in nature
	- `lectures.part2oop`
	- part2oop is a sub-package of lectures package
	- as of scala 3, the base package folder is found under project_name/src/main/scala
	- in scala 2, the version he was using, the base package folder is found under project_name/src/
- package object
	- is a scala specific code organizing structure
	- they hold standalone methods/constants
	- package object is used when we want to have methods, constants that must be available throughout the package
	- normally we would put our package object in a separate file called package.scala in a package that it corresponds to
		- there can only be one package object per package
		- the name of the package object is the same as the package that it resides in
	- inside the package object, we can define methods or constants and then we use them by referencing their name and not having to import anything
- imports:
	- to import more than one class in scala
		- `import playground.{PrinceCharming, Cinderella}`
		- here playground is a package and PrinceCharming, Cinderella are scala class files
		- I have a feeling that scala does not consider files in import, when we import a file, we are importing the class
		- file name is not considered in the package hierarchy
		- for example if the Cinderella class file consists two classes namely: Cinderella and Tindu, to use both I need the following import statement:
			- `import playground.{Cinderella, Tindu}`
		- we can alias when importing
			- `import playground.{Cinderella => Princess, Tindu => TT}`
			- within the module, we can start using the classes with the aliases that we have given
		- when classes with the same name are imported from two different packages, the first import takes precedence
			- to differentiate, we need to alias or use fully qualified name while using
- default imports
	- classes within java.lang are pre imported: Object, String, Exception
	- scala package - Int, Nothing, Function
	- scala.Predef -> println, ???
