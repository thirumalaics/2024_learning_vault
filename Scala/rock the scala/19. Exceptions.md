```
val x: String= null // let's say nulls was returned by some method call
println(x.length) // this will fail
```
- the above code errors out with NullPointerException
- throwing exception takes the following format:
	- `throw new NullPointerException`
	- throwing an exception is a expression
	- the above  expression returns Nothing
	- the expression can be assigned to variables
	- `val aWeirdVar = throw new NullPointerException`
		- I do not understand the use of this assignment as the program crashes as this statement is executed
	- since the return type or the type of the above expression is Nothing, we can assign this to variable of all the types
	- exceptions are instances of classes, above NullPointerException is a class
		- what really happens is we are throwing an instance of a nullpointerexception
	- an object must be throwable in order to be used in the throw expression
		- to be throwable, the class of the object must extend `Throwable` type
		- exceptions and errors are extensions of Throwable and are the common throwable subtypes
	- exception and errors will crash our jvm
		- they are different in their semantics
		- exception denote something wrong with the program
		- error denote something wrong with the jvm(ex: StackOverflow)
- catching exceptions
	- I checked the following exceptions and all of them accept a string arg and have a getMessage method
		- OOM, SO, RTE, NPE
```
try {
// code that migh faile
} catch {
	case e: RuntimeException => println(s"caught runtime exception ${e.getMessage}")
	case e: NullPointerException => println("caught npe")
	
} finally {
	// code that will get executed no matter what
	println("Always")
}

```
- obviously one the exceptions listed in the catch block are caught
	- the exception that is not caught is printed with the message that is passed as an argument
	- the error that is displayed in the terminal(ones which are not caught are printed as their full qualified name)
		- ex: java.lang.RuntimeException
	- this proves that exceptions are JVM specific and not scala specific
- important to note that try catch finally is also an expression
	- they can be assigned to a variable and can be inspected
	- the variable would be of type AnyVal
		- this type would depend on the range of values that are seen in the last line of each code block
		- for some reason the last expression in the finally block does not seem to affect the type of the variable
			- he explained: finally is optional and does not influence the type of the expression
			- finally typically used for side effects

```
val x = try{  // type is inferred to be int because try and catch blocks return int
  myFun(true)  
} catch {  
  case e: NullPointerException => 1  
  case e: RuntimeException => 2  
} finally {  
  "printlnI always get printed)"  
}
```
- exceptions are instances of special classes, which themselves derive from Exception or Error
	- we rarely need to derive from error
```
class MyException extends Exception
val exception = new MyException
println(exception)
throw exception
```
- since our custom exceptions are nothing but classes, they can have methods, fields, params 
	- we usually need name or print stack trace utility method 
```
val ar = Array.ofDim(1,2) // creates an array with one row two columns
ar.mkString("Array{","<","}") // cryptic op
```
#doubt 
- what if I wanted a multi line code block to be executed if I face an error
```
class DivisionByZeroException(val message: String) extends Exception  
class BoundExceededException(val message: String) extends Exception
```
- not able to access message attr in objects of the above class
