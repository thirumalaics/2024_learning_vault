- we can add a string and int, the operation will be a string concatenation
- scala compiler infers types returned by functions and types of variables/values
- even when we provide type details for a variable, compiler obviously does infer and cross checks with what we have given
	- if not matching, error is thrown
- recursive function types are not inferable

## Recursion
- in order to run a recursive function, JVM uses a call stack to keep partial results
- each call of the recursive function uses what we call a stack frame
- trouble with the approach is that, JVM keeps all the calls in it's internal stack
	- which has limited memory
- stackoverflow Error happens when the recursive depth is too big
- the normal factorial code will give out stackoverflow error for big numbers
```
def anotherFactorialFn(n: BigInt): BigInt={
	def helper(x: BigInt, accumulator: BigInt): BigInt = {
		if x == 1 then accumulator
		else
			helper(x-1, x*accumulator)
	}
	helper(n,1)
}
println(anotherFactorialFn(50000))
```
- why does this method work whereas n\*recursion(n-1) not work?
	- to make things clear, defining the function as an auxillary function above does not do anything special
		- the function was defined like that so that the main function accepts only one argument
	- helper(x-1, x\*accumulator) is written as the last expression in the code path
		- it allows scala to preserve the same stack frame and not use additional stack frame for recursive calls
		- scala does not need to store intermediate result that needs to be used later
		- helper(10, 10\*1) is replaced by helper(9,9\*1) in the stack and so on
			- without using extra stack mem
		- this is called tail recursion
			- use recursive call as the last expression on each code path that it occurs
		- we can ask the compiler to enforce tail recursion by using the following annotation
	- in this case, n\*recursion(n-1) , scala needed recursive call stack frame for each recursive call
		- so that it computes each intermediate result and then multiply it with a number and pass it back in the stack
		- here the recursion function call does occur as the last expression
```
import scala.annotation.tailrec // for scala 3, import req
def anotherFactorial(n:BigInt): BigInt = {
	@tailrec // compiler throws an error if our fn def is not tail rec
	def factHelper(x: BigInt, accumulator: BigInt): BigInt = {
	if <=1 accumulator
	else
		factHelper(x-1, x*accumulator)
	}
}
```
- when we need to loop, use tail recursion to avoid stack overflow error
- are function argument types necessary
- have as many accumulators as arguments as the number of recursion branches needed
