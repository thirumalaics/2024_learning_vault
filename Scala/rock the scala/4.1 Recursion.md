- we can separate recursion problems in to head and tail recursion
- head recursion carries the risk of so error, should the recursion go quite deep

- head recursion
```
def recursion(l: List[Any]): Int = {  
    l match {  
      case Nil => 0  
      case head :: tail => 1 + recursion(tail)  
    }  
  }  
  
  
//  @tailrec  
  def tailRecursion(l : List[Any], acc: Int = 0) : Int = {  
    l match {  
      case Nil => acc  
      case head :: tail => tailRecursion(tail, 1 + acc)  
    }  
  }  
  
  val le = (1 to 100000).toList  
  try  
    println(recursion(le))  
  catch  
    case e => println(e)  
  //  println(le)  
  println(tailRecursion(le))
```
- what is the importance of tailrec annotation?
	- tells the compiler to verify the code has been compiled with tail call optimization
		- what I gather is that, tailrec annotation tells a compiler a function is tail rec and the compiler applies some optimization
			- looks like this optimization is to turn this recursion fn call into loop
	- explicitly marks a function as tail recursive
	- it is not necessary
	- even ic I remove the annotation and try running the function, it works fine
		- tested
