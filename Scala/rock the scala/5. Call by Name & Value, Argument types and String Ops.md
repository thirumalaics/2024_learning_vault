```
def call_by_value(x: Long): Unit = {
	println("the value is " + x)
	println("the value is " + x)
}
def call_by_name(x: => Long): Unit = { // the => here tells the compiler that the parameter is called by name
	println("the name is " + x)
	println("the name is " + x)
}
call_by_name(System.nanoTime()) // nano seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01
call_by_value(System.nanoTime()) // the outputs in the fn print the same val
```
- the values printed will be different even though they print the same variable
	- in the above function, time functions in scala returns values in Long
- in the by value call, the exact value of the argument expression is computed before fn is evaluated
	- the same value is used within the function def
	- same as in other langs
- in the by name call, the expression in the argument is literally passed by name and the expression is evaluated every time x is used in the function
	- => , in this context, delays the evaluation of the expression passed as an argument
	- the variable's value is materialized each and every time the variable is accessed

```
def infinite(): Int = 1+infinite()

def printFirst(x: Int, y:=> Int): Unit = println(x)

printFirst(infinite(), 24) // if this is executed, fails with SO Error
printFirst(24, infinite()) // this function call succeeds without any issue
```

- the second function call succeeds because the value of y is not evaluated as the variable is not used anywhere else than the function definition
- the first function call fails because it is a call by value, the value is first materialized and then passed along
	- while materializing itself Stack Overflow error


## Default & Named arguments
- default valued arguments
```
def tailFact(acc: String = "",n: BigInt): BigInt = { // default value
	if n == 1 then acc
	else tailFact(n-1, acc+myString)
}
val myString = "Hi"
val fact10 = tailFact("", 10)
val fact10Def = tailFact(10) // this will not work
val fact10 = tailFact(n = 10)
val fact10 = tailFact(n = 10, acc = 'Hi') // order does not matter
```

- the problem posed by positional arguments above can be solved via two methods:
	- pass in from the leading arguments(above first function call is the example)
	- name the arguments
		- this will tell the compiler to consider default values for other arguments than the one that is passed
		- naming the arguments while passing them allows us to pass the arguments in the order we like

## String Ops
- 0 indexed
```
val str: String = "Vanakkam dsa"
println(str.charAt(2)) // prints n which is of char type
println(str(2)) // same effect as charAt
println(str.substring(1, 3)) // 1 is inclusive and 3 is exclusive
println(str.split(" ").toList) // by default the type returned is array, here we have converted it to list
println(str.startsWith("van")) // returns boolean
println(str.replace(" ", "-")) // replaces all spaces with -
println(str.toLowerCase())
println(str.toUpperCase())
val numString = "45"
val num = numString.toInt()
println('a' +: num :+ 'b') // appending and prepending a char to a string
println(str.reverse)
println(str.take(2)) // first two chars of the string as a string
```
- the array type returned by the split is very weird
	- `[Ljava.lang.String;@566776ad` this was the output
	- mkString does the trick
- many of the above functions are java function available in scala
	- scala has access to string class in the java language
- lhs of +: should be a **Char**, otherwise compiler threw an error
	- the lhs can be another string but the result will now be a vector and not a string like before
- rhs of :+ should be a ***Char***, otherwise compiler threw an error
	- the rhs can be another string but the result will now be a vector and not a string like before
