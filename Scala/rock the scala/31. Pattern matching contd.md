- only Any type expression can be pattern matched with other types
	- remember when I tried to patter match a String variable with other data types, I got a compilation error
```
val x: Any = "String"  
println(x match {  
  case 1 => "A number"  
  case true => "The truth"  
  case "String" => "A String"  
  case pattermatchcontd => "A singleton object"  
})
```
- to match anything, one way to do is to use wildcard
	- the wildcard he has been using is \_
	- the inferred type for the following variable is Unit
```
val matchAnything = x match {
case _ => 
}
```
- another way to match anything is to use variable
	- the variable then can be used as part of result that we return, which is not possible with underscore
		- `case _ => s"I have found ${_}"` // errors out
```
val matchAvariable = x match {
	case something => s"I have found $something"
	case _ => "whatever" // never reached
}
```
- pattern matching is also possible with tuples and other simple data structures
```
val aTuple = (1,23)
val matchATuple = aTuple match {
	case (1,1) => 
	case (something, 23) => s"hey I found $something along with 23"
}
```
- nested pattern matching
```
aNestedTuple match {  
  case (_, (something1, something2)) => s"I found $something1 $something2"  
  case (_, (something1, (something2, 1))) => s"I found all this $something1 $something2"  
}
```
- following pattern is called constructor pattern:
```
val aList: MyList[Int] = Cons(1,Cons(2, Empty))
val matchAList = aList match {
	case Empty => s"Hey the list is empty"
	case Cons(head, Cons(subhead, subtail)) => s"My nestedd list looks like $head , $subhead , $subtail"
}
```
- to import a class a class from a file, I think the file name should be the same as the class name
	- if there are multiple classes or objects in the file, I do not think we can import anything other than the one with same name as the file
		- confirmed in code file for this video
	- let's say I have a file name general.scala with a object general
		- from this file I can import general and using the dot notation I can access classes or object definition
		- or I can import like: `import package.general.class_inside_general_object`

- list patterns
	- list itself is not a case class, the list constructor extractor exists in the scala std lib: advanced
	- \\\_\* denotes a list of arbitrary length


```
aStandardList match {
	case List(1, _, _, _) => //extractor
	case List(1, _*) // var arg pattern
	case 1 :: List(_) => // infix pattern
	case List(1,2,3) :+ 42 => // another infix pattern
}
```

- type specifiers

```
val unknown1: Any = List(1,2,3,4)
unknown1 match {  
  case x: List[Int] => println("hey it is a list")  
  case x: Int => println("hey it is an int")  
  case x: String => println("String bro")  
  case _: Any => println("It can be anything")  
} // output is hey it is a list
```

- name binding: binding a name to the pattern or a sub-pattern itself
	- this allows us to use name later in the result expression
```
val aList: MyList[Int] = Cons(1, Cons(2, Empty))  
aList match {  
    case pattern1 @ Cons(11, _) => print(pattern1,11)  
    case Cons(e1, pattern2 @ _) => print(pattern2)  
  }
```
- multi patterns are multiple patterns chained by a pipe operator
	- aka compound pattern
```
val multipattern = aList match {
	case Empty | Cons(1, _) => println("hey")
}
```

- if gaurd

```
val secondElementSpecial = aList match {
	case Cons(_, Cons(specialElement, _)) if specialElement == 2 =>
}
```

```
val numbers = List(1,2,3)  
  
val s = numbers match {  
  case listOfStrings: List[String] => "LS"  
  case listOfInt: List[Int] => "LI"  
  case _ => ""  
}
```
- surprising output of LS rather than LI
	- not scala's fault but JVM trick question // jvm is not the compiler
	- in earlier versions of Java, there was no generics
	- generics were introduced in Java 5
	- to make jvm compatible with earlier versions of java, java 5 erased all generic types after initial type checking
		- which makes jvm oblivious to generic types after definition
	- scala also suffers this fault
	- so even though in pattern in above snippet has generic type, while run time it is as if the [String] and [Int] are not present
	- type erasure
