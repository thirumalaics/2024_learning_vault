- special type of collection
- method calls on null objects result in NPE and app crashes
```
val string: String = null
println(string.length)
```
- presence of null might make us write multiple checks which makes code messier
- we would need a data type that would encapsulate possible absence of a value
- Option is a wrapper for a value that might be present or not
- Some wraps a concrete value
	- Some is a case class that extends Option
- None is a singleton for absent values
	- extends Option as well
- Options are present in many parts of scala std library
	- ex: in Map we use get method instead of the apply(errors out), in that case:
```
val map = Map("key" -> "Value")
val f: Option[String] = map.get("key")
val g: Option[String] = map.get("Key")
```
- the inferred type for both f and g are `Option[String]` denoting the possible absence of a value
	- get method might return a value or indicator denoting the absence of such value
- lists also return Option subtypes while using some methods
	- head method errors our when called in empty lists
	- so there is a headOption method which returns an Option instead
```
val l: List[String] = List()  
val lho: Option[String] = l.headOption
val ll:List[Int] = List()  
println(ll.find(_ % 2==0))// Option[In]
```
- creating options can be done in two ways
```
val myfirstOption: Option[Int] = Some(2)
val noOption: Option[Int] = None
```

- options were invented to deal with unsafe APIs
	- basically functions or methods that may return null due to some cases
- Some cannot be passed with null value:
	- `val result = Some(null)`
	- especially passing the result of a function call directly to some is dangerous especially if the method may return null
	- `val result = Option(unsafeMethod())`
		- apply method from the companion object of Option will take care to build a Some or None depending on the value returned
		- this helps us avoid extra checks
	- We use Options to do null check for us
```
def unsafeMethod:String = null  
def backupMethod: String = "null1"  
val chainedResult:Option[String] = Option(unsafeMethod).orElse(Option(backupMethod))  
println(chainedResult) // op is null1
```
- in the above code snippet, my prefferred API is unsafeMethod, but in the case that it returns a None backupMethod's result will be considered
- when we are designing an API it is best to return Option of something when there is a possibility of returning nulls

```
def betterUnsafeMethod(): Option[String] = None
def betterBackupMethod(): Option[String] = Some("A valid Result")

val betterChainedResult = betterUnsafeMethod() orElse betterBackupMethod()
```
- the advantage of using the above design is that the users of our methods do not have to wrap the functions calls with Options
- options have the following methods:
	- isEmpty
		- to check if the option is a None
	- get
		- unsafe and can lead to No such element exception when called on a None
		- tries to retrieve value from an option
	- map
	- flatMap
		- receives a function that turns an element into an option
	- filter
		- can turn Option with a value into option of no value, if the predicate does not return true
- because options support map, flatMap and filter, they also support filters
- java.util.Random and scala.util.Random are equivalents
```
def intOption: Option[Int] = Some(10)  
def intOptionNone: Option[Int] = None  
  
println(intOption.map(_ * 2)) // 20
println(intOptionNone.map(_ * 2)) // None
println(intOption.filter(_ % 3 == 0)) // None
println(intOptionNone.filter(_ % 3 == 0)) // None
println(intOption.filter(_ % 2 == 0)) // Some(10)
println(intOption.flatMap(x => Option(x * 19)))   // Some(190)
println(intOptionNone.flatMap(x => Option(x * 19))) // None
```

```val host = config.get("host")  
val port = config.get("port")  
val connection = host.flatMap(x => port.flatMap(y => Connection(x, y)))  
val connectionStatus = connection.map(x => x.connect)  
println(connectionStatus)  
connectionStatus.foreach(println)
```
