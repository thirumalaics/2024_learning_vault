- single class inheritance present in scala
- extends keyword
	- extending a class means inheriting all non-private member
	- this is the first mention of private, he has still not spoken about these
- so how to define a member of a class as private:
	- `private def eat = println("i eat")`
	- makes this method accessible within the class only
- private, protected are called as access modifiers
	- `protected def eat = println("i eat")`
	- for use within this class and subclasses
		- the child class can access this method from it's class definition
			- not via it's objects
		- no mention of objects
- private and protected members(I tested with methods) are not accessible by objects of the parent or child class
```
class Person(name: String, age: Int)
class Adult(name: String, age: Int) extends Person
```
- the above code does not compile because when we try to instantiate the child class Adult, the jvm tries to call constructor of the parent class first
- scala compiler forces us to guarantee there is a correct super constructor called when using such a derived class
	- basically we have provide how to call the parent class something like this:
```
val monkey = "Nayanu"
class Person(Name: String, age: Int){
def this(name: String) = this(name, 0)
}
class Adult(Name: String, age: Int) extends Person(Name, age)
class Adult1(Name: String, age: Int) extends Person(monkey, 21)
class Adult2(Name: String, age: Int) extends Person(Name) // in this case aux constructor is called
```
- all the above are valid definitions
- overriding a method can be done as follows
	- only protected and public methods can be overriden, not private methods
	- even if I try, errors out saying new method overrides nothing
```
  class Dog extends Animal {  
	var puthu = "temp" // instance var
	override val creatureType = "Domestic" // this is treated as an ins var
    override def crunch = {  
      println("Woof crunch")  
      super.crunch  // callign the protected parent method
    }  
  }
```
- even variables can be overridden using the override keyword like above
	- looks like only vals can be overriden, not vars
	- a val can be overriden only by a val
	- to put it in simple words: mutable variables cannot be overriden
