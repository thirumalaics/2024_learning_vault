```
abstract class Animal {  
  def eat: Unit  
}  
  
class nonAbstractAnima {  
  val newLife = "Alive"  
}  
val myAnimal = new Animal{  
  def eat: Unit = println("eating")  
}  
myAnimal.eat  
println(myAnimal.getClass)  
println(nonAbstractAnima().getClass)
```

Output of running the above code is: 
```
eating
class part2oop.anonymousClasses$$anon$1
class part2oop.anonymousClasses$nonAbstractAnima
```
- as we can see the object myAnimal's class is an anonymous class
	- anonymous class looks like inline class definition without a name
- the above code's classic equivalent is as follows:
```
class anonymousClasses$$anon$1 extends App {
 def eat:Unit = println("eating")
}
val funnyAnimal: Animal = new anonymousClasses$$anon$1
```
- anonymous classes can be written on top of a concrete class as well
```
class Person(name: String) {
	def sayHi: Unit = println(s"Hi. My name is $name")
}
val jim = new Person("Jim") {
	override def sayHi: Unit = println(s"Hi. My name is marry")
}
println(jim.getClass)  
println(jim.sayHi)

```
- output of the above code is:
```
class part2oop.anonymousClasses$$anon$2
Hi. My name is marry
()
```
- this concept of anonymous definition works for traits and classes(abstract or not)
- some rules to keep in mind
	- pass in required constructor arguments if needed
	- implement all abstract fields/methods
