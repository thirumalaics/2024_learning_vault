- invariant does not allow the child class to be used in place of a supertype
	- `val obj: myGeneric[A] = new myGeneric[B]`
	- the above statement only works when A = B

- covariance
	- the problem that invariance avoids is: a child type cannot be substituted for a parent type while using a generic class to instantiate objects
		-  a cat box cannot be an Animal Box. while we could put a Dog in Animal box
	- what if we could not put a Dog in the box, then we could just get our cat back without a problem and there will not be any breach of type
		- basically when we are allowed to substitute a subtype for a supertype but we cannot add any other subtype than the one we have already used
		- the variables typed with A should be immutable within the class
	- formally, given some `class Cov[+T]`, then if A is a subtype of B, `Cov[A]` is a subtype of `Cov[B]`
	- covariances does not allows us to modify variables of type A in the object
	- ancestor type can be replaced by descendant type
	- covariance allows us to write generic code

```
class myGeneric[+A](val myVal: A) // this cannot be var
class Animal(name:String)
class Cat(name:String) extends Animal(name)
class Dog(name: String) extends Animal(name)

var obj: myGeneric[Animal] = new myGeneric[Dog](new Dog("Thiru"))
val myDoggie: myGeneric[Dog] = new myGeneric[Dog](new Dog("Thiruq"))  
obj = myDoggie
```
- without covariance, the following is not possible: `List[A]` is covariant
```
def printAnimals(animal: List[Animal]): Unit = {  
  animal.foreach {  
    x => println(x.name)  
  }  
}  
val cats : List[Cat] = List(Cat("Then"), Cat("Then1"))  
  
val dogs: List[Dog] = List(Dog("Simon"), Dog("Ethan"))  
printAnimals(cats)  
printAnimals(dogs)
```

 
- contravariance
	- given `class Con[-T]`, if A is a subtype of B, then `Con[B]` can be used in place of `Con[A]`
		- the reverse is not true at all, it gives out an error
	- functions are contravariant
	- contravariant classes cannot have member variables which are of type T
		- only class parameters which cannot be accessed my any object
```
class Con[-T](myBoi: T)  // in this case it cannot be var or val
  
  
class Animal(var name:String)  
class Dog(name: String) extends Animal(name)  
class Cat(name: String) extends Animal(name)  
  
  
val cat = new Cat("Tindu")  
val animal = new Animal("Kuttan")  
var myOb: Con[Animal] = new Con[Animal](animal)  
  
var myOb1: Con[Cat] = new Con[Cat](cat)  
myOb1 = myOb
```
