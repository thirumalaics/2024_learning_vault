- within a package, no two scala object files can have classes with the same name defined at the top most level
	- even if the class signature, arguments are different

 - the following notations are syntactic sugars
 - infix or operator notation
	 - works only with methods that take one parameter
	 - `object method parameter`
	 - the method in between acts like an operator
		 - hence the name operator notation
	- scala has an extremely permissive method naming scheme, so even method called + can be used
	- + operator is implemented with numbers: 1.+(2)
		- mathematical operators act exactly the same way as methods because they are
		- ***all operators are methods***
		- alt + space after the dot displays all the methods available for an object
- prefix notation
	- unary operators are also methods
	- unary methods do not take any parameters
	- `val x = -1` the minus here is a unary operator and is the same as `val x = 1.unary_-`
		- unary operators are methods prefixed with unary_ followed by the operator symbol
		- this prefix only works with few operators: -, +, ~, !
		- unary methods must be defined with a space: `def unary_! : String`
			- otherwise the colon is understood to be part of the method name
- postfix
	- does not accept any parameters
	- fns that do not accept any parameters can be used in a postfix notation
	- `println(mary isAlive)` equivalent `println(mary.isAlive)`
		- rarely used as only diff is space v .
		- bad readability for us
	- in scala3, to use this postfix feature we need to import: `import scala.language.postfixOps`
- apply
	- this method can be defined within a class and must be with parentheses
	- `mary.apply()` == `mary()`
	- it is as if mary is a function
	- whenever compiler sees an object being called as a function, it looks for the definition of apply method inside the class
	- check if apply method accepts any parameters
