- within a package, no two scala object files can have classes with the same name defined at the top most level
	- even if the class signature, arguments are different
	- if Person class is defined at top most level in one of the file, I cannot define a Person class in the same package in a diff file at the top most level, but I can define one inside an object or class
- everything in scala is an object

 - the following notations are syntactic sugars
 - infix or operator notation
	 - works only with methods that take one parameter
	 - `object method parameter`
	 - the method in between acts like an operator
		 - hence the name operator notation
	- scala has an extremely permissive method naming scheme, so even method called + can be used
	- + operator is implemented with numbers: 1.+(2)
		- mathematical operators act exactly the same way as methods because they are
		- ***all operators are methods***
		- alt , space after the dot displays all the methods available for an object
	- every object can be treated as a method provided that it has an apply method
- prefix notation
	- unary operators are also methods
	- unary methods do not take any parameters
	- `val x = -1` the minus here is a unary operator and is the same as `val x = 1.unary_-`
		- unary operators are methods prefixed with unary_ followed by the operator symbol
		- this prefix only works with few operators: -, +, ~, !
		- unary methods must be defined with a space: `def unary_! : String`
			- otherwise the colon is understood to be part of the method name
- postfix
	- does not accept any parameters
	- fns that do not accept any parameters can be used in a postfix notation
	- `println(mary isAlive)` equivalent `println(mary.isAlive)`
		- rarely used as only diff is space v .
		- bad readability for us
	- in scala3, to use this postfix feature we need to import: `import scala.language.postfixOps`
- [apply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9737352/what-is-the-apply-function-in-scala)
	- this method can be defined within a ***class*** and must be with parentheses
	- `mary.apply()` == `mary()`
		- where mary is a instance of Person
	- it is as if mary is a function
	- whenever compiler sees an object being called as a function, it looks for the definition of apply method inside the class
	- check if apply method accepts any parameters
		- yes it can
	- the apply method that I create adds syntactic sugar only to the objects of the class
		- from scala 3, there is a universal apply method that is available which wraps the constructor
			- so I do not have to use new keyword
```
class Tmp{  
  var d:Int = _  
  def apply(): Tmp = new Tmp()  
  def apply(s: Int): Tmp = {  
  
    val x = new Tmp()  
    x.d = s  
    x  
  }  
}  
  
val ob = new Tmp  
println(ob.d)  
val ob1: Tmp = Tmp.apply(1)   // I can't even call this method on the class
// the apply methods that I define are applicable for the objects, they are instance methods and not class methods
val n = ob(1)
```

- `(+myNayanu).age` is not the same as `+myNayanu.age`
	- +myNayanu returns a new object so the parentheses matters, otherwise it is like calling the age attribute and applying +
- within the class if we want to apply infix: `this method var/value`
