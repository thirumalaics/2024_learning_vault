- join method is available for datasets as well
- but the only problem is that it returns dataframe
- calling join method with the dataset loses the type information
	- join method expects a dataset as argument, I think I should be able to pass a dataframe as well
- joinWith is for ds and returns ds
```
val joinedDS = guitarPlayersDS.joinWith(bandsDS, bandsDS.col("id") === guitarPlayersDS.col("band"))
```
- the inferred type of joinedDS =>  `Dataset[(GuitarPlayers, Bands)]`

- output is weird and the schema of \_1 and \_2 are struct types
![[8. Datasets#^6a8683]]
- this is because I read the df without inferSchema
- nulls are placed in case of outer join
	- even when we have not given the option annotation on the type of the source ds
- group by is available as in df, but ds specific groupByKey is also available
```
carsDS.groupByKey(_.Origin).count.show()
```
- return type is dataset of type String and long
	- col names are key and count(1) by default
- there are multiple agg functions
