- writing lambda functions in scala
`val myFunction: Int => Int = x=> x+1`
- almost every collection in scala has map, FlatMap and filter functions
	- these are called higher order functions
```
val increment: Int => Int = x => x+1
val processedList = List(1,2,3).map(incrementer) // this returns a new list
```
- i have left out some of the pattern matching stuff from the video as I do not have any idea about it
```
try{
	throw new NullPointerException
}
catch{
case e: NullPointerException => "Whatever"
case e => "Somethign"
}
```
- he brought the topic of Futures
	- they abstract computation on separate threads
```
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

val aFuture = Future{
42
}
```
- partial function
- implicits are auto-injects by the compiler
- case class: light weight data structures that come pre-packaged with factory methods
```
case class Person(name:String){
def greet = println(s"Hi my name is $name")
}
```

- spark session
```
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

object myOb extends App{
	val spark = SparkSession.builder().appName("myApp").getOrCreate() 
}
```
