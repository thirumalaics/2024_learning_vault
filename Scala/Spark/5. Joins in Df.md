- after joining, when I tried to drop columns with the same name from both dfs, the alias approach did not work
```
df1.alias("a").join(df2.alias("b"), col("band") === col("b.id"), "inner").drop("b.id","a.id","band")
```
- the ids were not removed in the resulting dataframe
	- but the following snippet worked:
```
df1.alias("a").join(df2.alias("b"), col("band") === col("b.id"), "inner").drop("id","band") // both ids got dropped
```
```
df1.alias("a").join(df2.alias("b"), col("band") === col("b.id"), "inner").drop(df1.col("id"),df2.col("id"),df1.col("band")) 
```
- in the drop we can either use all arguments as column reference objects or string of column names
	- the above method is possible because spark maintains unique identifier for each column it deals with from each df
	- so when I use df1.col("band"), spark sees the unique identifier and removes the column which has that unique identifier

- we can rename the column while performing join
	- while passing as argument to the join
