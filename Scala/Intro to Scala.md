- multi-paradigm language
- object oriented and functional
- statically typed
- scalable from simple scripts to sophisticated(but still easy to use) lib
- scala runs in the java virtual machine
- works with Java VM tools/libraries/infrastructure
- used for big-iron projects in industry
- pragmatic choice as successor to java
- types: Int, Double, Boolean, String - not primitive type, everything is a class
- arithmetic operators: +, -, *,/,%
- variable type is inferred:
	- `val answer = 8*5+2`  int -> val means immutable value
	- can specify type after the name
		- var greeting: String = null - > mutable variable and value
		- in this case if there was no type, scala will not be able to infer the type as it is null
	- semicolons at the end of a statement are optional
	- strongly typed
- commonly used types:
	- Int, Double, Byte, Char, Short, Long, float(caps), Boolean
	- everythin in scala is an objects, so methods can be applied on objects
	- 1.to(10) // apply to method to 1, returns Range(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
		- applied to an integers: to method
		- before calling any method on int, the int is converted to rich int
	- java.lang.String available in Scala
		- augmented by > 100 methods in string ops
		- "Hello".intersect("World") // yields lo
		- before calling any method on string, the string is converted to string ops
	- val x:BigInt = 123456789
	- x * x * x
	- infix notation
		- 1 to 10 same as 1.to(10)
		- applicable only when one argument is required by the method
		- val result = 1.+(10) // + is the name of the method here # regular method notation
- ++, -- does not exist
	- counter+=1
