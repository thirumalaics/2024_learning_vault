- micro - study of individual actors, firms, people, households
	- how actors make allocations/decisions of scarce resources and how does it affect the prices, markets
- macro - study of economy in aggregate
	- what happens to the aggregate economy as a result of millions of actors
	- often focuses on policy related questions
	- top-down questions
- there is an attempt to make both mathematical
	- by making assumptions ex: all people are rational and they are going to maximize their gains
	- results must be analyzed with a pinch of salt
	- but these results are valuable

## Scarcity
- economy exists because there is this notion of scarcity in the world
- if there is more demand for something that exceeds the existing quantity
	- who gets it, how much do they get it and what do they have to give up in exchange to get those resources
- scarce resource is one that is limited
	- not enough to satisfy unlimited wants of people
- rival good/resource: one person consuming it limits ability for others to use simultaneously
	- cake - me eating entire cake will limit the ability of my friend to consume it
- economists will sometimes create a spectrum on how rivalrous a good is
	- house is a rival good
	- very few perfect non-rival good
		- but there are goods close to it
		- air to breathe outside(when inside a closed container, it becomes rival)
		- roads at 3 AM

## four factors of production
- land, labor, capital and entrepreneurship
- land can in general mean natural resources
- capital in economics sense can be something that is produced in order to produce other things
	- ex: tools, building, machinery
- entrepreneurship/technology
	- putting things together so as to produce things
	- technology = entrepreneurship and know how
- two types of things that can be produced from all the factors of production
	- capital: where we generate something which can be used to build other things
	- consumption goods: goods that are used and not used to produce any other thing
	- a factory might have to decide how much of capital and consumption goods to generate
		- there must be a trade off
## Economic model
- taking complex systems, making simplified assumptions in order make sense results in a model
	- and using this model in place of the original
- depending on the model, there are going to be simplifying assumptions that take complex systems into simple equations, lines or charts

## Normative and Positive statements
- normative = thinks how the world should be, opinions
	- paying people who are not working, even though they could work is wrong and unfair
- positive = not necessary to be true but can be tested
	- programs like welfare reduce the incentive for people to work
