- given a scenario where I am a hunter gatherer, I spend z amount of time hunting and gathering
- if I were to experiment on how much I can hunt an animal and gather a type of berry in time z by dividing specific times to both activities and plot them on a two dimensional plane
	- x axis represents amount of animal
	- y axis represents amount of berries
	- a point in the graph represents animal hunted and berries gathered for a particular split of time
	- assumption is that the only thing that changes is amount of time I spend on hunting or gathering
		- everything else is assumed to remain the same
- this graph represents production possibilities frontier

- points outside(towards the right of) the curve is impossible
	- as the curve represents what is observed
- points inside the curve are possible but not optimal

## Opportunity Cost
- opportunity cost is also called as marginal cost
	- cost in terms of quantity of an alternate commodity that we give up in order to produce one more unit of a commodity
	- some times marginal cost can sometimes be in terms of money
		- money that costs in produce one more unit of a commodity in question
- in the rabbit vs berry case, the opportunity cost increases as I go for one extra rabbit
	- it may not a general phenomenon that opportunity cost raises for every extra unit
