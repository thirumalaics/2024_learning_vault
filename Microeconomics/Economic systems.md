## Property rights
- crucial for proper functioning of an economy under a market based system
- who owns what and what they can do with that property
- price signal
- ability to own and use resources(also anything made from those resources)

## Economic System
- system of allocating scarce resources by answering 3 questions:
	- what will be produced?
	- how will it be produced?
	- how will the output society produces be distributed
- how these questions get answered depends upon the type of economy the system is part of:
	- decisions about allocation of resources and allocation of production and consumption are decided by
		- the government in command economy
- in market economies, there is private owner ship of resources - established through property rights
	- factors of production and consumption are all coordinated through markets
	- in a market system, resources are allocated to their most productive use through prices that are determined in markets
		- these prices act as a signal for buyers and sellers
- most economies are mixed economies
- in either system, a rational agent would allocate resources and production using marginal analysis
- in command economies, this is more difficult to do because without markets, prices fail at being an effective signal
## Markets and property rights
- a market forms when multiple parties exchange things of value
- there are different markets
	- ex: one where we buy groceries, one where we buy stocks, one where we auction for things
- for markets to function properly we need property rights
	- idea that things can be owned
	- cultural agreement
	- 3 real properties of property rights
		- exclusive ownership
			- sole right to the benefits of the thing of ownership
		- enforceable rights
			- some enforcers must be helping in enforcing these rights
		- transferrable rights
			- property rights must be transferrable
	- markets in many sectors or countries may not be functioning as well as they could because some of the above mentioned dimension of pr is not functioning well
- what is a market?
	- place where buyers and sellers meet to engage in mutually beneficial, voluntary exchange of goods, services or productive resources
- what is a household?
	- owners of resources - supplied to firms in the ***resource market*** 
	- and the buyers of goods and services- demanded from firms in the product market
- what is a firm?
	- business entities that demand land, labor and capital from households in the resource market
	- produce goods and services, which they supply to households in the product market
- what is a resource market?
	- market where households supply land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship/technology to firms in exchange for money
- what is product market
	- where firms supply goods and services to households in exchange for money
- what is an economic system?
	- system of allocating the means of production and goods and services produced in an economy
- what are wages?
	- the payment, firms make to households in exchange for their labor
- what are rents?
	- they payment firms make to households in exchange for land
- what is interest?
	- the payment firms make to households in exchange for capital
- what is profit?
	- payment to entrepreneurs who start or own business
- market economy?
	- in the purest form, a market economy answers the three economic questions by allocating resources and goods through markets, where prices are generated
- command economy?
	- in the purest form, a command economy answers the three economic questions by making allocation decisions centrally by the government
- circular flow model
	- illustrates how a market economy works
	- households and firms engage in mutually beneficial exchanges of resources and produces in the market
	- households are the owners of factors of production and sell labor in exchange for wage, land in exchange for rent, capital in exchange for interest
	- money flows in one direction - counter clockwise - and goods, services and resources flow in the opposite direction - clock wise
	- in a market economy, one of of the main functions that money serves is to facilitate the exchange of goods in the product market, exchange of resources in the resource market
