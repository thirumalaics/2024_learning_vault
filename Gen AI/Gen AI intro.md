- subset of traditional machine learning
- Gen AI describes algorithms that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos
- GPT - Generative pretrained transformer
- machine learning is a type of AI
	- through ml, ai is developed through models that can learn from data patterns without human direction
	- until recently ML was limited to predictive models, used to observe and classify patterns in content
	- Gen AI is a breakthrough where, rather than simply classifying, machine learning is now capable to create an image or text description of a cat on demand
	- supervised model - humans do the teaching by pre-labeling
	- next generation of text-based models rely on self-supervised learning
	- the results generated depend on the quality of the model and the match between the model and the use case, or input
- ai
	- classification
		- make decision about x
			- x is a multidimensional vector
	- generative
		- understand the distribution of data
		- sample from a distribution to generate a new example from the data distribution
			- learning data distribution is the central problem done using deep neural nw
		- structure of data is captured in its dimension
		- strong models that learn the structure of data, generate new data
		- the generation is controlled by conditions
- Generative Artificial Intelligence describes algorithms that can be used to create new, realistic content that reflects characteristics of the training data. It can produce a variety of content including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. It has tremendous potential to help us become more productive.

- well established architectures used to develop Gen AI
	- embeddings to represent high-dimensional, complex data
	- variational autoencoders use an encoder-decoder arch to generate new data, typically for audio and video generation
	- generative adversarial networks use generator and discriminator to generate new data, often in video generation
	- diffusion models add and remove noises to generate quality images with high levels of detail
	- transformers for large language models such as GPT, LLama and lambda
	- neural radiance fields for generating 3D content from 2D images
