- select only the required columns
- use having clause only for filtering on an agg
- reduce the number of subqueries
- IN operator has the slowest performance
	- most efficient when most of the filter criteria is in the sub-query
- use exists instead of left semi join
- try to use UNION all in stead of UNION
- BETWEEN better than >= and <=
