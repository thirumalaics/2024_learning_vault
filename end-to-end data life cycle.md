- no two data projects are same
- nearly all data projects follow the same basic life cycle from start to finish
- 8 steps:
	1. Generation
	2. Collection
	3. processing
	4. storage
	5. management
	6. analysis
	7. visualization
	8. interpretation
- why cycle?
	- insights and lessons learned from one data project typically inform the next
	- in this way final step of the process feeds back into the first

### Generation
- data generation occurs regardless of whether we are aware of it
	- some by our organization, customer or third parties
	- every activity generates data

### Collection
- not all data generated is collected or used
- decision of the data team to identify what information should be captured and the best means for doing so
- diff ways of collecting data:
	- forms
	- surveys
	- interviews
	- direct observation
- many organizations capture as much data as possible and store it for potential use
- but it is important to have a plan to capture data that we know is critical to our project

### Processing
- data processing can include:
	- data wrangling: data cleaning and transformed into something more usable and accessible
		- data munging, cleaning and remediation
	- data compression: transformed into a format that can be more efficiently stored
	- Data encryption: translated for privacy concerns

### Storage
- store the processed data for future use
- commonly achieved through creation of databases or datasets
- always good to add redundancy for the data

### Management
- aka database management involves organizing, storing and retrieving data as necessary
- ongoing process that takes place from the beginning through the end of a project
- might include many steps like encryption, storage, data monitoring(for change logs and access logs)

### Analysis
- process of obtaining meaningful insights from data that is stored
- analysts use different tools and strats to conduct these analyses
	- ex: statistical modeling, algos, artificial intelligence, data mining
- who performs the analysis depends on challenge being addressed, as well as the size of the team

### Visualization
- creating graphical repr of our infor
	- typically using visualization tools
- for quick and easy-to-understand communication of the analysis
- the form of visualization depends on data we are working with as well as the story we want to communicate

### Interpretation
- make sense of analysis and visualization
- understand what the implications of what the data shows
